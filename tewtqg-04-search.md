# Search

When it comes to a search, it's really hard to find a player on search engine markets who at the same time would be privacy-respecting, whose search results are not total garbage and whose narrow regional or professional specific does not make it a niche player. Let’s say, Cốc Cốc is a search engine, serving only the Vietnamese internet segment, or Wolfram Alpha is popular with a scientifically-related search. 

It’s important to understand that privacy does come with a price, in our case, the price of giving up personalized search experience and adjusting search relevance to your needs. It could be said, the strength of these search engines is literally at the same measure their weakness. However, since about 95% of search requests do not assume utilization of any sophisticated search algorithm, and usually lead to a well-known Wikipedia page, internet-service, or social network, it could be considered not a great loss. 

There are several decent alternatives to major search services. US-based DuckDuckGo and its European counterpart, Qwant, meet provided requirements. 

#### DuckDuckGo 

DuckDuckGo reportedly provides the best search relevance among privacy-oriented search engines, especially when it comes to image search. Duckduckgo allows you to search through just a slash, which could be handy for accessing search from a script. Also, it is partly integrated with Apple Maps for providing location-related search, however, its usage is quite limited and not even near GoogleMaps (see about it below, in Maps section), probably these are license restrictions do not let them use more advanced features. 

#### Qwant

Meanwhile, the French search engine Qwant suggests some sort of combining search personalization with strict privacy regulations of EU-based service. Yes, this is the only privacy-oriented search engine, allowing you to create an account. Qwant has a news feed, search by music, and search for kids. Quant utilizes OpenStreetMap for the search over locations and directions, but at the moment of creating this article, service is still in beta. 

#### Startpage 
Startpage service provides a different approach, serving as a proxy-anonymizer between user and Google, effectively preventing Google from collecting sensitive user data. Tor browser has Startpage as a default search engine, which is an effective advertising of the service among privacy defenders. Service comes with StartMail, secure and private mail service. 

#### SearX
Also, an interesting alternative could be provided by the so-called meta-search engine SearX. This service aggregates search results from 82 different engines (as per April 2020), similar to Startpage protecting the user against data collection. 

Service start page provides a bit unusual user experience, as it allows you to choose the node before performing the search (to be exact, metasearch). Clearly a service for the audience with above-average tech skills. 

My personal favorite is DuckDuckGo – however, I also advise diversifying information sources, combining your search providers. In general, diversity is a good idea applied to almost every internet service. When I’m not satisfied with the search relevance, I’m trying Startpage. It is considerably slower, because first it always makes a request to Startpage servers, which redirects it to Google, effectively erasing your personal details. It is a reasonable price for privacy.
