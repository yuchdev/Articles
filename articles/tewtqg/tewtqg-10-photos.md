# Replace of Google Photos

Before we begin our review, we need to assume, all cloud storage provides also offer basic photohosting features, so if you hust want to save photos for yourself, in most cases you donâ€™t need a separate provider for your photos and videos. However, I can name two reasons for choosing a separate photo hosting - if you need professional features for photographers, like built-in photo editing or displaying raw file formats, or maybe interested in professional photo album printing services, there are a variety of professional and semi-professional services. Another group of potential photo hosting users might be more interested in is privacy features, like limiting access to sertain photos only to a company of friends or a family, or being sure your photo service is not making a harvesting metadata of your photos its business model.

Migration from Google Photos is as simple as migration from Google Drive - you just download all your photos. Google Photos itself does not offer downloading all photos at once, you may do it with the help of already familiar to us standard [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) tool. Downloading the entire photo archive is a good occasion to sort out all your images.

#### [Piwgo](https://piwigo.org/)

Piwigo is open source photo gallery software for the web. Designed for organisations, teams and individuals.

It allows users to upload photos from photo editors like Lightroom or from mobile applications.

Extended features of creating albums and trees of albums, and sorting by author, tag, or location, if you don't mind to have this information attached to your photos.

The service offers a lot of templates and themes, allowing you to showcase your photo collection in an unique way. Handy service feature is the fine-tuning of viewing permissions, allowing you to show your photos to a particular viewer.

Piwgo features applications for all mobile platform. After the 30-day trial period expire, you should select individual of business subscription plan.

However, Piwigo is not just great opensource product, but also could be configured as a self-hosted solution on your own server totally free of charge, which is a great option for studios and design companies.

#### [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)

Flickr is already well-known among professional photographers and designers, not only as a photo-hosting, but vast social network of professionals, working with photo and video, and such professional orientation is a distinct feature of platform, setting it apart from other photo services. Of course, there are tons of ways you can organize your photos, creating albums and groups, galleries and photostreams, tags and descriptions. Service users have an access to extended statistics, letting them know which photos visitors consider the most successful. You can create contacts with other service users, just like in any social network, and social engaging, discussing works of each others is a vital part of the platform success.

Unlike most of other photo hostings, Flickr offers a free tier with 1000 photos available (as per July 2021), smart photo management and photo editor. Android and iOS applications available for viewers.

#### [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/)

Historically, very few photo services feature desktop applications, and it makes a perfect sense - designing and implementing a good desktop application is complicated, so they stick to web options. In case of Adobe, they already had more than enough desktop applications to choose from, so they just added the option of cloud photo storage. If you purchase a license for any of Adobe applications (Lightroom, Photoshop, or Illustrator), you receive a generous amount of cloud storage. And from the other side, if you choose a plan for publishing existing photos, if usually including a license for a desktop application (the choice of applications depends on the tier).
About pricing options, it looks a bit expencive at first glance, but given the choice of services under the Adobe's umbrella, it all makes perfect sense. It's an access to Adobe Stock, service of royalty-free images, Adobe Portfolio, the tool for creating a complete personal portfolio website, access to vast library of Adobe Fonts, and many more.

#### (23snaps)(https://www.23snaps.com/)

23snaps service positioning itself as a "Online Family Photo Album". Despite of being also called "mini-Facebook", it has a line in Privacy section I liked - "we promise that we will never share your personal information, photos, videos or updates without your consent".

Available features are fairly simple - you can create albums and share by the link, or by adding specific people to a "trusted list", and you can order physical prints and Photo Book. This is the only paid option you will find on the website, however, after you start using iOS and Android applications, you may also choose one of subscription options. I could not find anything about physical limitations of the service, but the paid version allows uploading HD videos "up to 3 minutes long".

So yeah, this is option which is not even close to professional photo hostings, but if you need just safe place to share photos with friends and family, this is it.
