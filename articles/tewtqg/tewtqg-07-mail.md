# Mail

Probably, if you decide to award some type of communication, which is in active use in 2021, for being the most outdated, the most vulnerable, and by all means the most annoying, when all participants of a conversation mindlessly use “Reply To All” function, email is going to win it by a large margin. Email is the Achilles' heel of user and data privacy, and using it for sensitive communication in the age of Signal and Telegram is an unpardonable crime against yourself. 

However, every time you need to create and activate an account in literally every internet service, you need email (also, if you're a bottom manager and you like pissing off your colleagues by adding all your departments to CC). 

Google is collecting so terrifying amount of data from your mailbox so that any talk about Gmail privacy should be considered a joke. It collects your contact information, your contacts, your messages content, your messaging patterns, your search history across your messages. It even scans your attachments for invoices and receipts, to track your purchase history. From the point of spam protection, it’s hard to call it outstanding as well. Most spam emails in absolute measures come from Gmail.

#### Requirements 
The main and totally reasonable requirement to the modern mail service under consideration is asymmetric encryption so that not even mail providers or government officials could ever access the content of your emails (there are black-magic techniques from NSA labs, but it’s beyond our consideration).

An optional requirement is Integration with Calendar service, of course, encrypted as well, and probably business features like custom domain name and multiple users with different access privileges under the one account. Locating these services in the privacy-favorable legislative field, at the best in the EU gives your privacy legitimate protection by the law. 

Mail provider should have a reliable anti-spam reputation, so that not to find its domain completely blocked on your recipient's side.

Also, after enjoying all these beautiful features, usually comes the understanding that before you paid for your mail with your privacy, but now for more or less comfortable work you have to pay monthly, effectively proportionally to a number of your emails and storage occupied by your messages and attachments. Pretty much every secure mail provider offers a free basic plan, but in my experience, it's too limited for intense daily usage. 

#### Possible options
There are plenty of ethical mail providers on the market with a variety of features. All of them offer end-to-end encryption, all transfer your messages as “envelope” rather than “postcard”, all support 2FA, all of them publish their source code under one of the opensource licenses (or at least plan to), which allows performing regular audits on vulnerabilities and privacy leaks, many accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for a service. Also, none of them require personal data for verification. 

##### Protonmail 
This service was developed by scientists from CERN and MIT. Protonmail is built around privacy - it features end-to-end encryption, does not keep user’s IP addresses in logs, and does not share your registration data with any 3-rd parties. It provides a number of security levers like separate decryption passwords, has a flexible business plan, allowing to create a custom domain, offers Android and iOS applications. In addition, Protonmail offers encrypted Calendar, VPN, and Drive services. It also accepts Bitcoin for payments.

##### Mailfence
This security-centric service allows you manual PGP keys control, and also provides you with full control under your account. You cannot use Mailfence to send encrypted messages to people who don't use OpenPGP and have no public key available. It's possible to use Bitcoin as one of the payment options. Simple and secure mail service, not without downsides though - at the moment of creating the article, it was not open-source, even though the administration promise to open the source code eventually. Service also has minor bugs, e.g. I could now whitelist one of my services, which notifications were consistently appearing in the Spam folder. Because of such downsides, it suits only for not very sensitive communication.

##### Disroot
It is a decentralized cloud-based service that allows you to communicate and store your files, targeting people whose privacy is a matter of life and death, like journalists and activists working in totalitarian states, where disclosing your correspondence easily may cost you a life. Has a very detailed setup procedure, I had to write a bloody essay to prove I'm not a robot or CCP member, was waiting almost for a week for my account to be approved, and their confirmation code is the most secure I ever received so far. Service features IMAP/POP3 support, spam and virus protection, and in addition offers a full suite of applications, including Cloud storage, Calendar, Gallery, and Notes.

#### I do not recommend
##### Tutanota
Another secure mail provider, located in Germany I’ve been recommended. However, I could not create an account there, accessing it from my IP, even though other mail providers were okay with it - that’s why I can’t recommend this service even for non-sensitive data.

#### Migration process. 

Migration of your existing email account (or accounts) is arguably the most time-consuming compared to any other services, even though is not that complicated. You just need to follow simple steps, and following them would make your experience less painful. 

1. Create a new, shiny email account on your private and secure provider. This step is extremely satisfying because the easiest way to get to inbox zero is to start a brand-new inbox.
2. Ehhh… What do you plan to do next, it’s totally up to you. Reflect on it a bit, before reading further. 
3. Most probably, you want to import all your contacts to your new email service. It could be thousands, and the problem becomes even more complicated if you have to migrate contacts from multiple accounts from different providers, and complexity grows exponentially if you for some reason want to export them to multiple accounts of different email providers. This is how Kashmir Hill from Gizmodo describes her situation:
So in preparation for the week, I export all my contacts from Google, which amounts to a shocking 8,000 people. I have also whittled down the over 1,500 contacts in my iPhone
Luckily, the majority of secure email providers took care of this step and provided more or less detailed exporting instruction. For example, here’s the one I used for exporting my contact base from Google Mail and Yahoo to Protonmail. In general, it almost always providers allow import/export in CSV format, and it’s really a convenient solution. Protonmail exporting contacts procedure.
4. Here comes an even a bit more challenging task… What if you want to export not only your contacts, but also all content of your mailboxes? Honestly, I did not bother myself with this step, since the next step would probably make it unnecessary. However, user-oriented services like Protonmail offer special Import-Export applications.  
So that not to make you think I endorse Protonmail only, here’s truly elegant, even though a bit time-consuming solution of exporting email base from Google Mail to Mailfence, involving the export of your account data through a 3rd-party desktop email client. I advise you to use the Mozilla Thunderbird, however, come on, Outlook is also fine if you are comfortable with it. 
An additional perk of this, hm, intensive solution, it will work for pretty much any provider, supporting POP3 and IMAP protocols, I would say 9.9 of 10 nowadays.
5. After that you probably decide to set up redirect or auto-reply on your only email account, notifying about sudden changes in your life, for good of course - or not to set it up, if you don’t want to hear from them again. I was surprised, how many users enjoyed this particular outcome.
6. Okay, you exported your contacts, your contents, set up notifications… But why do you hear boss music? That’s right, it’s your other accounts, connected to your email account, in most cases using it as a username in credentials. If you migrate your email account, which you normally use for registering new accounts on web services of all kinds, there’s does not exist and cannot exist a single, universal tool to accomplish this process. To be fair, no tool exists which is possible to do it even one-to-one. Most of the work you have to do manually, accessing your web service from old credentials, and initiate a procedure of changing email. Sometimes it’s as easy as changing your displayed user name, sometimes it requires a multi-step operation, involving the creation of secondary email, assigning it primarily, making previous account secondary, removing secondary account… Sometimes, I won’t tell the name of a company with a big bitten apple, migrating process will just freak you out.
6.1. Amount of work you have to carry out seems so staggering, you even feel lost where you need to start from. No fear, dear user, I did it once, and going to do it twice (about the reason for this controversial decision a bit later) - it means you can do it as well.
6.2. First, you need to create a list of your accounts. I assume, as a responsible privacy-conscious user, you utilize some sort of password manager? Or you do not? My respect, you remember hundreds of 16-20 symbol passwords with alphabetical symbols, digits, and special symbols… Because using the same password for all of your accounts is a terrible, terrible idea, even this password is complicated enough. So, you access documentation for your password manager, and in most cases, there’s an option of exporting all your accounts INCLUDING passwords. That’s why this option contains multiple warnings, that exported file is probably the weakest point of your desktop security.
6.3. That’s why, right away after export is finished, immediately delete all passwords. It’s relatively easy, because usually, password managers have the option of exporting your accounts in CSV format. Just open \*.csv file in Excel or another spreadsheet editor (offline editor, do not even think about using something like Google Docs), delete column containing passwords, and now you can save this file first as CSV, and then export in Excel format, for your convenience.
Some password managers, like browser built-in, don’t have a dedicated export option. They don’t have export extensions either, because of security concerns, extensions can’t access the local account database. No worries, usually there are some 3rd party applications available, like FF Password Exporter for Mozilla Firefox. 
Using such a 3rd-party application, make sure you can trust it 100%, as you trust it the most valuable content of your desktop. Choose only a well-known application, proven its credibility. Download it only from the official website. And yeah, I hope you understand it MUST be open-source and undergone a complete code audit, to make sure there are no bookmarks in the code. 
6.4. Since the exported file contains all your logins and passwords in plain text format, without any encryption, probably a good idea to save this file to an encrypted partition or even better to a password-protected encrypted file container, like VeraCrypt. If it seems to you these safety measures are just too much, you are mistaken.
6.5. Okay, you have your account list. First, clean it up. Yeah, probably after years of using your password manager and almost automated copy-paste-save, you have a considerable amount of non-existent accounts or accounts you wish you never created. Latter ones you may probably decide to keep in your password manager with an “irrelevant” tag, it’s all up to you. Also, believe me, your list would contain tons of doubles (triples, etc), especially if you exported it from the browser. One set of credentials has been saved during account creation, let’s say, www.myservice.com/sign-up, second has been saved for regular log-in, www.myservice.com/login, well, you got the idea. If you ever changed your username before, your old username also remained in the database. 
6.6. Now it’s time for really creative work. You should classify all your accounts. There are many categories you may come up with, but I give you a hint about a couple of them which really helped.
First, imagine your migration work would take days, maybe weeks or months. That’s why classify all your accounts by migration priority first. Probably, it’s a good idea to migrate your internet banking before your pizza delivery service. Don’t make too many priorities, it may easily confuse you. For example, classification I used: 1 - ASAP; 2 - as I have free time after work; 3 - in background mode during the nearest 3-4 months, 4 - do I really need to migrate it?
It’s also a sound idea to make your next classification based on the nature of your service. Finance? Work? Entertainment? Social Networking? Dating? During this process, you would probably notice, how it correlates with migration priority. Also, this classification will definitely do a good job for you, if you decide to create a separate email account for registering every other type of service. This decoupling process is called “compartmentalization”, and is recommended unanimously by many experts of the IT Security industry. 
6.7. It’s a good idea to sort your accounts list using the Excel sorting feature, I mean, sorting by the whole row, without losing the correct order of other columns. Use sorting by priority so that go top-down, and not to miss even one account. After you finish, keep this file "just in case”, of course, using some encrypted storage, and probably an external storage device. Maybe I ask you for the impossible, but my advice is also keeping this list up-to-date - who knows, maybe you’ll have to repeat this operation in the future? 
7. When this arduous process is finished, finally you can... oh no, don’t do it! Do not delete your old Google account. Download all your mail instead, clean it up, set up an unbreakable password with 2FA, and simply don’t use it. Why so? I think, you won’t be happy, if your email address would become vacant someday, allowing a possible intruder to register an email with exactly the same login.

#### Hardening of your public account credentials
Before even starting step (6), you should carefully think about choosing email (or more likely emails) for registration of your public accounts. After all, you choose the login name for all of them. However, at this point, one great idea may visit your mind - why choose only one email (and consequently, only one login) for all your accounts? Let this idea sink, and explore possible options.

The first possible option is so-called “account compartmentalization”, already mentioned. You pick up separate emails to register your Shopping/Social media/Personal/Banking/etc. accounts  - make it as many “compartments” as you want. Thus, compromising one of the emails does not put in jeopardy emails from other categories. Even if spammers get one of your emails, it would be not so hard to perform migration of every single account within the compartment one more time.

However, the option with compartments still bears a significant amount of risk. When you compromise one of the emails, you still put at risk all accounts you registered on this email. Just imagine, it was an email serving for your Banking compartment. Isn’t that scary? The ultimate security option is to use a different email and consequently, different login for every single account. However, how it could be possible technically? In theory, you can create as many email accounts as you need, but imagine the nightmare of managing them. If you also think some solution should already exist to manage such numerous emails, you will be right.

The first option, easier in implementation, would be to use email sub-addresses or aliases. The syntax of the email address is familiar to any internet user, first there should be a local part, followed by the ‘@’ symbol, and then the domain part. However, few users know that you can put the ‘+’ sign at the end of the local part, and add any string after that sign, and it will be considered the same email as it was without a part after + (complete Subaddress Extension specification explained in RFC 5233). Even the option is easier and gives technically unique login for every account, for example, fred+reddit@mail.com, fred+banking@mail.com, any spammer will easily be able to realize, what is your basic email address, that’s why this option is so-so.

The second and the ultimate option for creating unique accounts is a private mail relay, also called email alias service. Basically, it’s a service, which allows you to create an unlimited number of full-fledged email addresses, and after that act like a forwarder of your email messages, from “fake” email addresses to your “real” address, hosted on public mail service of your own mail server. This effectively creates a truly unique identity for every website where you should log in. Technically, it is an SMTP mail server, which requires a decent amount of configuration to perform forwarding. You may create a separate email for your every account, and a private relay will forward it to your mailbox, which you should keep in absolute secret. If your alias becomes disclosed, you simply create a new address for this service, change the email you use for login, and delete the compromised email address. For every new web service asking for your email address, just create a new alias. In addition, if you want to change the “real” email, it should be as easy as changing one setting on your service configuration page.

You can utilize this by no means invaluable service not only for account registrations. You can hide your personal or business email behind the alias, for this purpose private relay services allow you to replace your email in the field FROM to an alias. Speaking of business usage, redirecting emails from numerous addresses to a single employee is also a completely legit use case.

There’s quite a choice of email aliasing services, including free:
•	Firefox Relay
•	SimpleLogin
•	SocketLabs
•	AnonAddy
•	ImprovMX

Detailed comparison of these services is beyond the scope of this article; however, I promise to make a complete review of every one of them after completing the series about Google alternatives.

#### Self-hosted solutions

It’s hard not to mention the increasing trend in the private-oriented community to use self-hosted solutions as a replacement to public cloud-based services. Such solutions are as private as possible, they do not depend on policies of data sharing, local data disclosure legislation, you can host them in any country and under any jurisdiction you prefer. However, as usual, the freedom comes with a price of responsibility, and resorting to self-hosted mail service, you should absolutely understand what are you doing, and have deep technical expertise in DevOps, especially with the part of network and internet security. In theory, you can delegate the initial setup stage, purchasing a so-called “bastion host” on AWS marketplace, Virtual Private Instance with extremely hardened defensive setting and even already installed and configured mail server, or use pre-configured Docker image. However, here you also have to take into account, that relying on the system where you don’t know how to perform maintenance, or change configuration settings is quite a dangerous practice.

Review of self-hosted solutions is beyond the scope at least of this part of the article. Probably, I will do an overview after covering the replacement of most Google services with publicly available alternatives.

Perhaps, I need to mention separately about self-hosted private relays, because it’s my personal preference over publicly available email aliasing services, and I personally recommend it, if you have appropriate technical expertise. As I said, a private relay is basically an SMTP server, but not necessary you have to perform its configuration from the scratch, instead, you can rely on a pre-installed and pre-configured set of applications, carefully packed in Docker containers. Here you also have some options available: self-hosted version of mentioned above SimpleLogin, my service of choice, and also extremely flexible Heimdall. Migration to a self-hosted private relay was the reason why I had to perform step (6) of my migration guide twice.

And finally, one more consideration, probably useful to you even before you start the migration process - it is hard to call desktop email clients a “self-hosted solution”, but even so, they are extremely valuable for your privacy protection. You should know, that tracking you is considerably harder with the email client instead of a web-based mail interface. The popularity of mail client applications significantly declined over the last few years, but old good Mozilla Thunderbird is still able to do a great job on your desktop, and security-focused K-9 can serve you for good on Android.
