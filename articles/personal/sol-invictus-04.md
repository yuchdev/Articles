# Chapter 4

I thought about this conversation later and even read something on the topic. Not that I was looking for it on purpose, it's just when I came across resonant information, I remembered about Hans-Friedrich.

For example, I read somewhere that the imperial name "August" comes from divination by the flight of birds. The Romans had special priests, augurs, who were watching over them. They noted what kind of birds there were, in which direction they were flying, what sounds they made, and so on.

But unfortunately, this practice does not work for us. Or rather, it would better not to work. After all, everything you need for augury is around: you look at the wet pigeons around the garbage dump or at the sparrows fighting for a piece of shit, and you roughly understand how it will go further. And that is exactly what's happening, birds don't lie.

It also turned out that the word "inauguration" is also har this roots and literally means "receiving signs from birds". I got it too. They elect a president, gather on a large square, and then a wing of fighters flies above, and everything turns clear to everyone at once.

But this is a collective group augury. Not exactly the personal method that Hans-Friedrich was talking about.

What did the Roman do to get a sign from the birds? He would put on his best toga, climb onto the roof, make a libation of wine, burn incense – I don't know exactly how they decorated their puja – and looked at the sky.

Let's say, at first an eagle appeared and gained altitude in circles. Then a pair of crows flew by cawing. And then – a flock of some migrating cranes.

The Roman consulted his augur tables (there must have been such) and wrote down the conclusions:

*The prospects for the advancement of the Fourth Legion to Germany look favorable, but you should avoid moving in a straight line. There may be attempts by the people's tribunes to prevent the financing of the military campaign, inciting strife and disputes. It is necessary to prepare for border clashes with detachments of migrating tribes...*

Well, or something like that.

The method of Hans-Friedrich was very different. It wasn't necessary to climb up to the roof. It was necessary to follow the process in your own mind, at the same time noticing what is happening in your immediate surroundings. And if, for example, you were thinking about pizza "four cheeses" (and reflexively swallowing saliva), and a fat pigeon was sitting on the windowsill at that moment, then you could safely order this pizza...

Or quite the opposite, do not order by any means if the pigeon is really fat.

That is, it turned out that interpretation still plays a decisive role. On the one hand, I liked it. On the other, why do you need a pigeon on the window at all, if there is an eternal existential dilemma without it... or rather, an abyss...

I should've asked Hans-Friedrich about more detail. Although, on the other hand, he said that the way is being found out experimentally and additional information will only hurt.

By the way, I tried to Google about Hans-Friedrich himself along with Arunachala. If he really went there often, there might be some traces left in the internet. Maybe he has already initiated others into this mystery, and I will find new details... However, I didn't find any photos or information about him.

But in one blog I came across this note:

"There is a legend that Lord Shiva appeared many times in the vicinity of Arunachala, giving teachings to pilgrims from different countries and cultures. He was called by many different names, always double: Jean-Paul, Ivan-Vladimir, Hans-Friedrich, Jose-Maria, John-Malcolm (to list a few known for certain). At the same time, his appearance was very different – from a cheerful, red-bearded man to a gray-haired elder who looked like a piano tuner. In various guises, he was giving the seekers teachings that were strictly corresponding to their level of knowledge. The teachings could be of very different nature – from skills in managing energy channels to the nuances of playing the sitar..."

The lady who wrote it starred for the avatar in swimming glasses and a low-cut evening dress. Other entries in her blog concerned the imminent energy aggression of Jupiter and the bunker near Berlin, from where Tibetan bonpos have been ruling Germany since the forty-third year. I didn't read any further.

My first thought was that Hans-Friedrich himself was joking[TODO:informal]. But it didn't look too much like him. Perhaps one of his acquaintances?

Or, I finally realized, the lady in swimming glasses also met him near Arunachala, went into his room to look at the candle light, and he was explaining her for a long time how to do snorkeling in an evening dress. And then, impressed by something she heard, she composed this sweet fairy tale. 

I had no other explanation. I hardly can imagine Shiva in the image of Jose-Maria, singing Desperados to the guitar 

Since then, I have noticed many times what Hans-Friedrich has called "encoded messages", as it happens, in fact, with any of us, including crazy zooracists, who have complaints about black cats. It did not lead to any serious changes in my life. Just the minor things. Maybe, just broke up with Egor a month earlier than I could have...

The difference between the secret revealed to me by Hans-Friedrich and the petty everyday superstition, somehow familiar to anyone, was in one word.

The journey.

When Daddy gave me his unexpected gift, no signs accompanied him. But I immediately, in the very same second – realized what I would do with this money.

"A journey that relies on itself and needs nothing else..."

Any journey should be started with packing a bag.

By the way, I have noticed many times a curious pattern – regardless of what I take with me and wherever I go, exactly half of the things turn out to be unclaimed. And this is still a good ratio – the average coefficient of my female colleagues is two-thirds. I mean, two-thirds of things never leave the bag until they get home.

To prevent this from happening, the packing of the bag should start with determining the route. At least the initial one.

Where would I like to go?

I both knew and didn't know.

When I was standing on the top of Arunachala and purple clouds with the personal seal of Lord Shiva were flying straight to my face, I almost understood where they were coming from. They were rushing from the center of everything, from the very source of the universe – at that moment it was obvious. You could literally reach this source with your hand, you just had to bend over the cliff a little...

And now I had the opportunity to really go on a journey, the possibility of those has been proven to my heart that day.

Now it was necessary to clearly explain this possibility to the mind, because it is quite difficult to travel around the physical world without its assistance.

Hans-Friedrich called it a "journey to the god." And that's what I had some difficulties with.

I have already said that I do not believe in gods, at least not in the sense in which church-bound citizens believe in him: there is such a prescribed by The Constitution menacing spirit, whose interests in our country are corporately represented by the Patriarchate (not to be confused with the patriarchate), although other exclusive dealers may work on the same market. Interestingly, no one saw the spirit, everyone saw only dealers. I have nothing against such a business model, but I don't want to buy an invisible afterlife Porsche from these people, with all due respect for traditions.

Every epoch chooses its truth, I heard somewhere. Or rather, their spiritual fashion, because there is as much truth there as there was in flared trousers or pleated skirts.

In one century they wear Indian, in another – Japanese and Tibetan, in this again Indian, but a little different. And if every house in Imperial Russia was a red corner with the image of Maria, and it's clear as day that in our time it should be advanced and progressive by all ninety degrees. There should be a nice sparkling statuette, corresponding to the trends of the day, under which would be appropriate to drink green tea with comrades in yoga and mindfulness.

When I say "statuette", I do not mean some kind of a particular divine essence. This is generally the approach of the last century. Today we believe mainly in techniques and technologies, leaving the "ultimate truth" out of brackets. Arguing about it is a kind of mauvais ton, rubbing grand words against each other, while living on very little money, is someway tasteless, I would say. Nowadays, if people found out [TODO:3rd-cond] what Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos really believes in, they would invest in there all what they have. I mean, their entire souls.

I wondered if my advanced peers had some kind of spiritual consensus, so to speak? In general, they do. Such a mixture of quantum physics of consciousness, pasteurized Buddhist and Hindu practices, psychedelic shamanism-lite and vague "viarism": the belief that our whole world is a virtual reality, a bloody VR game for perverts from another Universe. The ultimate question of God, therefore, should not be decided by us, but by the space perverts who created this virtual reality. What kind of demand [TODO:synonym] could be there from us, since we are just their playstation.

Interestingly, such a panorama of reality does not ripen independently in each individual head, but is being broadcasted in prepackaged state through the entire entertainment we absorb. We think that we eat cutlets, but cutlets gradually become our brain and think instead of us.

Who eats whom day after day is a complicated question, and if some people still think that cutlets are served separately from flies, then they live in a world of illusions. In the twenty-first century, cutlets are made exclusively from flies.

We are all like that today – instead of investing in media like religions or CDs, we just use a service like "dizer" or "mindfulness". Such a netflix of the spirit, where everyone, without exception, is subscribed to individual chosenness.

We're all the chosen ones today, aren't we?

It's a typical trick of marketers is to explain to the client that there is a very special club, or a special magazine, or an extremely significant director, writer or artist, pushed through a very special magazine, etc. etc. - and this is not a marketing product, but something that marketers themselves touch with delight and awe, for their own inspiration and happiness: an object from another world, spontaneously hovering above the bustle of the market, astounding with its greatness all the chosen who are ready to fall to it as to a spring...

Oh, how I would like to live in a world where this happens. But it is enough to track down a specific claque (is not to say cloaca) that creates this psychedelic haze, and the mirage disappears. And you can usually track it in three minutes, just lazy - why do I need it? Tag with the word "#exclusive" – a necessary precondition for mass sales. Everything is very clear and boring. Since the time of the artist Duchamp, the secular springs of the spirit are indistinguishable from urinals (Duchamp, by the way, could have exhibited a bidet as an object of art, not a urinal, otherwise it looks lame and patriarchal).

And if I'm diligently depicting high irony (or cynicism, I don't always quite understand what the difference is), then it's just because both of them also included in the right cocktail being made for us out there.

We are truly the spiritual children of Twitter and Netflix.

"Well, whose children are Twitter and Netflix, it's not difficult to trace," said a gloomy bass voice in my head, and I laughed. I even counted the letters–if with spaces, Twitter and Netflix gives exactly eighteen. Six repeated three times. 

No, seriously, what else do I believe in? Even a little?
Good question.

Well, in money, of course. In general, everyone who goes shopping believes in money – this is the very core of the scientific worldview. We will delicately skip this topic.

What else? In Lord Shiva? He was sending me purple clouds, right? Well, that's quite a complicated question. After all, I naturally prayed to him on the top of Arunachala. But it's not that I believe in him or don't believe in him, it's just because of cultural remoteness, he is more like a comic book hero for me. This is not a religion, but a game. Or a game with elements of religion, why not…

Let's just say that I love Lord Shiva with all my heart. But I can't say that I believe in him with all my heart. Who ever loved will understand me. And we will also omit this topic.

Do I believe in immortality of the soul? It depends on how to understand it. If the soul is immortal, what will you be like after death – three, twenty, forty? Or the way she was at the time of death? So, if you die an old woman, you will have an old woman's immortality, and if you are a child – a childish one? Or are they all being cut under the same comb? [TODO:analog] Or your life experience means nothing, and the soul does not change at all? Thats unclear. I really shoud clarify this with Lord Shiva at a personal meeting.

In general, it turns out that I really don't believe in anything. Our spiritual subscription implies, of course, the existence of some eternal truth, but wisely leaves it in the fog.

My "spiritual sphere" is an information cloud with constantly updated content, which is formed for me by someone unknown. But I'm sure that only the most modern, fashionable and the best will get there – how could it not?

It's stupid to even ask what I believe in. I don't believe it, I'm subscribed with all the advanced young individuals. Subscribed for what? For advancement. And what exactly it is at the moment, it is necessary to ask not from me but from the market.

But still there are some central crystallizations in the cloud of my spirituality. For example, about the fact that our world is a simulation. I'm really inclined to think so. When you play for a long time in 3D glasses at a good resolution, and then you take them off and see all this [TODO:synonym], you immediately want to take off your built-in glasses too. But alas, they are rigidly mounted in the case.

After all, who is doing this simulation? And for whom? And how? There are no answers to this in my spiritual netflix. There are no answers to any questions, the subscription cloud does not like them precisely for the reason that any final truth in itself is a separate subscription service and a direct competitor to the general subscription.

The world and all of us are a dream of God. Have you heard? I heard it too. So, we sleep on – since the God wants it that way.

On the other hand, some people seem to wake up. And they praise their experience very much. So God wants that sometimes, too? Or, as Hans-Friedrich says, is it just a role-playing game? Oh, almost entangled in this entanglement.

Here's what could be a good target for my ultimate journey: I would like to know from where these magical purple clouds flew to me that day on Arunachala, when the main secret of everything was close and accessible. Who is this thin golden silhouette dancing in the clouds? Who generates the world – and why?

Shiva, can you hear me?

In general, it is difficult even to determine the direction of the search… Everything is so vague. And, most importantly, I'm not sure I know what I really want.

I was thinking, and at that moment a crow cawed outside the window:

– A fairy tale! A fairy tale! [TODO:close]

That is, it may well be that the crow wanted to say something else, but I clearly distinguished this word in her hoarse solo. Repeated as many as two times.
A shiver went down my spine.
