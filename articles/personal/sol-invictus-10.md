# Chapter 10

There was not the slightest affectation in the way Frank was saying "Me" when talking about Caracalla. After a few sentences, I began to believe that I was listening to a living Emperor. It both pleased [TODO:synonym] me and scared me.

I liked making love to him (after all, we did it the very first night, and then in the next morning, instead of the planned excursion to the hippodrome, sorry Mehmet, and here we go), but I kept waiting for him to have strange requests.

And so it turned out.

In the evening we drank a lot of French Red after dinner, "Gallic", as Frank called it ("the Romans loved wine and intercourse, girl, but they left hemp smoke to the Germans, so today we smoke only one joint, two at most"), and then he said:

"Let's do it in masks."

"Why?" I asked.

He put his finger to his mouth.

We've already done it without masks, I thought, why not. We'll see…

When we were wearing masks, Frank behaved very differently, and it was fascinating. He wasn't just undressing his girlfriend, he was serving the goddess. In all his actions there was such deference, such non-feigned humility, that I really felt like a goddess being sacrificed to. And to be honest, I liked it.

When I was wearing the Moon mask, Frank was serving to me like a slave, kissed my toes and fanned me. He didn't demand anything in return. And in the end, I really began to feel like a mistress, lazily calling a slave to her bed, not when the slave wants, but when she wants.

It was an interesting and enlightening experience, because before I did not understand how a woman can dominate in sex, even playing her natural passive role. Then, of course, I realized – there is nothing special here.

Take, for example, some Catherine the Great.

Although I didn't really imagine how this Merkel, who fancied herself Putin, is able to cause sexual attraction in someone towards her, she had favorites, and I don't think they behaved too freely in her bedroom. Most likely, biological communication with the Empress was quite a ceremonial procedure, where almost every hip movement was accompanied by a bow. After Frank appointed me his goddess, I began to understand how it looked and felt back then.

In general, I liked the experience, and I was already waiting for Frank to get his masks. He usually put the Moon mask on the bedside table, and I put it on myself.

Why not? The mask didn't oblige me to anything, but it did oblige Frank to a lot. It felt just good with him without the mask. And with the mask it added to the feeling that I was having fun with a respectful servant. So what's wrong with that if I like the servant?

You could say, I thought, while my boyfriend was massaging my back, that every consistent feminist should strive for something like this. The most radical sisters do not even consider such an option and immediately go beyond the lesbian horizon, generally doing well without testosterone carriers. But a male slave is just the thing. This is not a gender revolution, but a return to a forgotten cultural and historical gestalt.

"How is the mistress feeling?"

"The mistress is almost satisfied."

"Why "almost"? What is missing?"

"Come here, I'll explain it to you…"

I played my role easily and effortlessly, as if since childhood I had been preparing for something similar... Although, every woman is ready for such a role deep down. You just need to create conditions for her. There is a goddess sleeping in any of us, waiting to be worshipped. Unfortunately, the patriarchy rarely allows her to wake up.

I no longer paid attention to his caracalla when we were walking around Istanbul. My empty head seemed lighter than ever, and I was probably happy.

I wanted to discuss our experience, and I told him that I liked his gallantry in intimate matters.

"Actually," I added, "it's amazing that a man's behavior is the exception rather than the rule."

"Why?"

"Traditional patriarchal culture implies it."

"Really?"

"Of course. In classical Europe, for example, it was customary to expect chivalry from a man. And chivalry assumes just such a way of male behavior in bed. Any girl who has watched any modern melodrama is awaiting for it… But in fact, even a well-mannered and delicate seducer behaves rudely and impudently at the most intimate moment. Worse than that, sometimes just like a swine… It shocks a girl. Sometimes it hurts. But this has only recently begun to be talked about."

Frank laughed.

"It's not about patriarchy," he said, "but about male physiology, which feminists don't care about."

"What do you mean?"

"To put it simply, the average man has a boner not for too long and not too well. If he misses the right moment, then later he will not be able to insert anything to anywhere. Especially if he doesn't really like his partner… That is, not "he" (Frank shook his finger at someone invisible), but the nature, which is responsible for an erection. Such depressing couples, let's be honest again, are the majority… I read the statistics. According to the subjective assessment of the respondents, sixty-three percent of men have a partner who sucks in a bad way, and only thirty-seven in a good one. Hence the type of behavior that a corrupted by corporate media woman perceives as violence. This is not violence, but a biological imperative that any sexologist knows. But for political reasons, this information is even more classified today than the racial correlation of IQ...

"And what is the racial correlation of IQ?" I asked.

The smile faded from his face.

"I shouldn't have said that," he replied. "It's better to forget it right away and don't talk about it to anyone. At least with the Americans. This is taboo for us."

Such phrases were alarming me. When Frank, figuratively speaking, took off his toga, it began to seem to me that he if not a white supremacist ("that's what they call people who watch Fox News", he explained), then for sure not a left-wing university humanitarian like his colleagues.

However, I never believed in IQ anyway, which is in my opinion a pure quackery. The only thing that determines the level of an IQ test is a person's ability to pass IQ tests. All other interpretations of this experience reduce the human brain and soul to a cheap uncomplicated mechanism.

Frank's phone was playing the song "Bella Ciao" by Tom Waits, and I often listened to it, because they started calling him, of course, as soon as he went to the bathroom and turned on the clipper (no hairdresser in the world, he complained, could properly cut the hair on Caracalla's image, and he had to fix his hair himself once a three days).

The words in the song were as follows:

*One fine morning I woke up early*<br>
*Bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao*<br>
*One fine morning I woke up early*<br>
*and found a fascist at my door...*

After all, they are a bit too pampered in America, they even have fascists delivered to their homes. Door-to-door delivery in 30 minutes or your money back. But I liked the song. So as Tom Waits himself, and especially the image projected by him: they say, there are worn-out, drunk and, as it were, lowered guys with such a diamond core inside them…

Of course, it's not true. Surely this Tom Waits doesn't get out of the gym. But the image is still inspiring.

I understood that this American Bella was not just a cover: the song had a subtext related to their politics and culture. But I didn't know what it was until Frank explained.

"Everyone thinks," he said, "that this song on my phone is a virtue signaling. I make it clear that I am an active romantic anti-fascist, ready to bite everyone who is ordered by the corporate media, and I have no particular complaints about the information or financial oligarchy. A useful record in the CV if a person is looking for a job somewhere in the Bay Area. But I'm not looking for a job there.

"And why then such a ringtone?" I asked.

"This song has amazing dramatics," Frank replied, "First, the lyrical hero wakes up, sees a fascist at the door and is so scared that he asks the partisans to take him (I mean, the lyrical hero) with him. The partisans, apparently, refuse – why do they need a coward? Then the lyrical hero again asks to take him away, assuring that he is no longer afraid... And then he begs to bury him beneath the shadow of a flower. Just the anthem of American snowflakes... Every time I listen and laugh... and real fascists, by the way, would sing this song like this…

*Eines Morgens als wir erwachten*<br>
*Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao ciao ciao*<br>
*Eines Morgens als wir erwachten*<br>
*fielen sie über uns her*

And he gave me a German version of "Bella Ciao" from a disco in Majorca. The perfect, as he said, SS march song.

Sounded right for the parade, yes. But I didn't understand the words.

"Don't worry, the Germans cleaned up the partisans right away," Frank grinned, "They only sing about Schönes Mädchen, beautiful girl. Like, the girl broke my heart. Fascist songs are not about fascism, but about beautiful girls. That's what our "snowflakes" need to listen instead of Tom Waits. In other way, they will meet a real fascist someday and decide that he's a merry chimney sweep…

Apparently, he did not like these "snowflakes".

"But what should we do," I asked, "if there really is a Fascist at the door?"

"And what does the word "fascist" mean today? According to one version, this is a man hiding a portrait of Trump at home, according to another – someone who does not have tears coming out fast enough during Greta Thunberg's speech in Davos. And if you forget about politics, a fascist is any person who interferes with your comfortable parking. Both in physical and spiritual sense…"

And Frank gave me a whole lecture about the political background of American *politico correctum* – behind it, as he assured me, was an attempt by the transnational financial and information elite to enslave minds in the same way as in past cultures they enslaved bodies, hiding the masters of the world behind a human shield of various teenage Gretas, crippled lesbians (here I lightly slapped him on the forehead), black activists, transgender Muslims and other symbolic staff, any disapproving look in the direction of whose will be fiercely punished.

"Today you can't really fight the establishment anymore," he said, "because the narrative managers have plastered its perimeter with all these cute kittens with Alzheimer's disease, wounded black teenagers, and so on. The shameless mafia is hiding behind a human shield, creating a narrative, but you can't spit in their direction without splatter all these Gretas…"

"What does Greta have to do with it?"

"Absolutely nothing. The fact is that a person who wants to spit at the elite and the establishment, inevitably has to spit at Greta, because the establishment has pasted her portraits on all its walls and doors. And people who don't understand what's going on, but feel that something's wrong, put a sticker "Fuck you Greta" on their bumper. Meaning not Greta, but this very establishment. Looks silly, of course..."

"Is there something you don't like about her?"  I asked.

"Who cares... It's not that somewhere in the world there is a kind Greta, so brave and honest little girl that corporate media inevitably report about her exploits. The fact is that the corporate media at some point begin to wash your brains with daily stories about this Greta. And it becomes problematic to send them to hell, because they may ask you – are you against the good Greta, you bastard? Media Greta is not a person. This is an aggressive pedophrastic narrative used by the transnational oligarchy in the struggle for control over your mind.

"I think she's really nice," I said dreamily.

He even turned green. How I love provoking him.

"Greta is not important here at all, how can't you understand. She may be the most sincere and kind being in the world, or she may be a 3D printout of a National Socialist poster, or she may not being at all. From the moment when the oligarchy puts on her disguise, it makes no sense talking  about her anymore. The woke-bijouterie is colorful feathers sticking out of the ass of the world's Brangelina Gates, crawling along the red carpet for another billion. It's just a new mask of Satan, which, just like the Guy Fawkes mask, all the world's morons immediately start wearing. We are the new serfs, that's what…

The former European serf, Frank said, could not leave his village, but he could think whatever he wanted. A modern American serf can travel all over the world and even fly into space if he has money, but his consciousness at the same time must run on a short leash around several pegs driven in by corporate media – "narrative shapers".

"Americans are not allowed to leave the zone of acceptable narrative. Even inside their own head. Otherwise, only one way left."

"Where to?" I asked.

He straightened his hair.

"To be an emperor…"

Generally, he was a complicated guy, but he fucked like a god (sorry, sisters in struggle). And the game of serving the goddess aroused him to such an extent that he was becoming a stallion. For the sake of this, it was possible to tolerate his slightly disturbing political views.

To be honest, such a necessity rarely arose. Everything modern was disappearing without a trace when he put on the mask. One of his souls was entwined by another, and I met a completely different person.

I liked the story of Caracalla, which he was telling in small pieces, usually after we made love. I listened to it half asleep, and it seemed to me that these were fragments of some novel that had not yet been written.

"We're going to Harran," he said one day.

"Why?"

"It used to be called Carrhae…"

His tone was as if it removed all questions.

"So what?"

"It's too long to explain."

"We don't seem to be in a hurry," I said.

And here we are again lying side by side in masks, reflected in the ceiling lamp…

When Frank had a sun mask on his face, I had full confidence that the spirit of the Roman Princeps had entered his body. I didn't even understand what language he was speaking at that time. Or rather, he spoke, of course, in English, but to me his speech sounded like Latin.
