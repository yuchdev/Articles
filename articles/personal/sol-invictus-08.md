# Chapter 8

Frank's Sith outfit still scared me, but gradually I got used to it. The dark side of the Force... Something similar has already happened to me.

"What are these clothes?" I asked while we were waiting for a taxi.

"Caracalla," he replied.

"Caracalla what"?

"That was the name of the Gallic cape with a hood, which was worn by Septimius Bassian. He is also Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, just do not confuse him with the philosopher Marcus Aurelius, who lived in the second century. In the third century, many emperors were called Marcus Aurelius. As before by Gaius Caesar. Caracalla is not the name of the emperor, but a nickname. He was nicknamed so because of this cape.

"Yeah," I said thoughtfully. "And then the emperor from Star Wars wore it. And Kylo Ren."

He nodded.

"Caracalla was about the same age as Kylo Ren. So they looked similar."

"Do you have a helmet with red seams?" I asked.

"No," he smiled.

"All right then. I thought already you are crazy."

"I'm crazy, but I'm fine," he replied. "I'm a peaceful psycho. And I have something better than a helmet."

"Listen," I said, "but then you need to carry a sword. If you're so serious about this question. And also, probably, fucking little boys all the time, like all Roman emperors."

"Well, not all of them," he replied. "And not all the time. Marcus Aurelius, for example, wrote that over the years he learned restraint in this matter."

"Okay," I said. "But you definitely need a horse."

"Caracalla didn't spend all his time on a horse. He sometimes just walked with his feet on the ground. My empathic experience is aimed precisely at these moments."

Frank's cape was a dark purple color, a pleasant and soothing shade. Such ties are loved by British TV announcers. Surprisingly, none of the people passing by us on the pier paid any attention to him.

"Listen," I said, "you look very strange in it, but no one is looking at you. Maybe you're just my hallucination?"

"No one's looking at you either," he replied, "So you might be mine…"

In the taxi, I finally relaxed.

Everything is fine, I'm in a warm, friendly Istanbul, we left the party, a new friend is coming with me. The same elements that make up thousands of human existences around. Life was developing in the right direction.

There were available rooms in the hotel. But Frank was not satisfied with the price.

"Two hundred and fifty dollars a night," he said. "I'd rather sleep with the legionnaires by the campfire."

"Sorry," I replied, "it will cost you at least five thousand dollars a day, and I don't want to spend that much on you yet. You can sleep at my place. If you behave yourself. The room is reserved for two adults."

"I always behave myself. Thanks, honey."

I was reminded of Tinto Brass's *Caligula*, and I thought that I had acted rashly. But then I realized that I was flirting with myself.

I was really ready for anything. Ever since the minute I felt that I liked him. Such decisions are made at a very serious level, the deep layers of the psyche, the entire inner Senate and Synod agree to this – and then, when their verdict reaches the surface of consciousness, a caricature game of hide-and-seek and compliance with the "rules" prescribed to a woman by the patriarchate begins.

The dialectic is, I would say, that the patriarchal way of life deprives another male of the joy that is fully due to him by the law of Nature.

Frank left his bag in the room and we went for a walk. When we passed by Sofia, I told her how I met So.

"Did you see the temple in your dream?" he asked in surprise, "And did it look similar?"

"Yeah," I nodded, "But not too much. Some elements did match up. Peacock and peacock tail on a yacht."

"Interesting," he said. "Very interesting. The same thing happened with Caracalla."

Well. This Caracalla gradually turned into an element of a three-bed "Lenin is with us". I was wondering how to translate this joke to Frank, but I remembered in time that we hadn't been in bed with him yet.

"How do you know?" I asked. "Have you read from historians?"

"No. Realized through empathy."

"Did you have a dream too?"

"I've had a lot of different dreams, but it's not about them," he said. "At the end of his reign, Caracalla went to the temple of the God of Moon. Lunus, as he is called in some chronicles, although he had many names. The main temple of the Lunar cult was located in Carrhae, which is now called Harran. And, Caracalla was brought there by a dream. Not even one, but a whole sequence of dreams."

"How can you understand this through empathy?"

He shrugged his shoulders.

"It's possible. We are all parts of the whole."

"I know," I said, "I heard something like that. But you have to have objective sources. Which you rely on not as a visionary, but as a historian. Do you have it?"

"When we come back, I'll show you."

He pointed at a sign on the wall.

"What is *The Basilica Cistern*?"

There was a short line in front of us, but I didn't notice any architectural landmark, only a house with three windows that looked like a tiny railway station. Probably, I guessed, something underground.

"I haven't been there yet," I said. "Let's go?"

In fact, I just wanted to postpone the moment when we would be alone in the hotel room. We were just in time with the last batch of tourists, the basilica was already closing.

The "cistern" turned out to be a huge storage for water with high arches and columns. Such an underground temple of Cthulhu (who else would be worshiped in such a place). I was struck by the huge heads of ancient statues used by builders as supports for columns. One of the heads was turned over for humiliation.

A mixed group of French and Germans passed next to us. They were led by a bespectacled European guide who spoke English. If you think about it, a serious humiliation for a united Europe. Frank and I joined from the back and were listening too. It turned out that it was the head of a Medusa, but the guide did not say where from and when it was brought. As I only understood, back in ancient times.

"We can see from this example," said the guide with a French accent, "that the situation when the entire previous culture turns into a quarry for the current one has been known to people since antiquity. However, it was not something new even in ancient Egypt… Culture is not only a self-sustaining, but also a self-consuming mechanism. Just like the human body. The past with its artifacts and stories dissolves into it without a trace…"

"It doesn't dissolve," Frank suddenly said loudly.

The guide looked up at him in amazement.

"It's losing the name. Becomes a homeless echo. We see and hear a lot of things that used to be something else. We just don't recognize them."

Tourists stared at Frank. A couple of people even clicked their phones: apparently, they were impressed by his Sith outfit.

"Perhaps," the guide smiled, "That's what I'm talking about, but... not so poetically of course. If you don't  mind…"

He turned and led his group away.

In addition to the hewn stone heads, I remember some mysterious signs carved on some columns. It's too high for tourists, and the carving looked very sharp. Perhaps it was a stamp of builders, but I didn't want to ask the guide.

We got out of the Cistern, walked around the evening Istanbul for a while, and at the end Frank got hungry. We sat down at a table in the same place where I had freshly baked bread with something like hummus yesterday, but after the culinary abuse on the yacht, I was no longer ready for such a sin, and Frank had dinner alone. I drank only a glass of local tea without sugar, and ate an apple.

The apple turned out to be sweet, and my conscience tormented me. But I was not thinking at all about the machinations of the ancient serpent, but about the glycemic index and excess carbohydrates.

In the room, Frank was the first to go to the bathroom and splashed in the shower for a long time. He came out in pajamas made of gray shorts and T-shirt, took his laptop out of his bag and began to connect to the network. I was the next to the bathroom. I didn't have pajamas, but there were decent bathrobes hanging there. Just my size.

When I came out, he was lying on the bed and smoking. Well, at least he was smart enough to open the window. I sat down on the bed, took the joint away from him, shook my finger at him and said:

"You promised to behave yourself. Remember?"

He nodded and made a serious face.

Stupid, I thought right there, what a stupid cow! Now he will be afraid of everything, because they have a concentration camp in America. Especially for white men. I've ruined everything for myself.

No wonder I became mad at him.

"Why did you start arguing with the guide?"

"When?" he asked with surprise.

It looks like he has already forgotten.

"In the basilica."

"Ah. He said that everything is disappearing. Nothing is disappearing. We live among reflections and echoes. Do you remember the head of Medusa?"

"I do."

"It was another temple nearby. Very old, already destroyed by Christians. When the Cistern was being built, they just dragged the head into the catacomb and turned it over, because they were afraid of her gaze. Or they no longer remembered who it was, and thought that the new god would reward for spitting at the old one. You come to look at the Byzantine water tank, but you see an echo of something much older than Byzantium itself. Do you understand?"

He probably had experience only with stupid girlfriends throughout his life.

"I understand," I said. "What could be not clear here?"

"The guide said that culture digests itself. Eats its past without a trace. And in my opinion, the past throws its seeds into the future. They sprout anywhere, and we no longer know what they were before. This happens especially often in poetry and music."

"Sprouting in what sense?" I asked, "Is the melody repeated? Or a rhyme?"

"It happens that some mysterious and hidden story pops up, but it is not recognized. Take is the same head of Medusa. Someone suddenly stumbles over it in a psychedelic fog. This often happened in the sixties, when lots of different enthusiasts at once began to dig our unconscious memory under LSD…"

He spoke interestingly and to the point, but I still felt offended.

"Can I have an example?"

"There are many examples. The Beatles, Pink Floyd and so on. But in all this huge archive, only one song is important to me personally."

"Which one?" I asked.

"Is there anything to hook Bluetooth on?"

There was an audio system in the room, and Bluetooth worked there. Frank fiddled with the connection for a while, and then said:

"Listen to this. This is King Crimson, «Moonchild». Imagine the waist-naked trumpeters blowing into the longest bronze horns. Such greenish pipes wrapped in shiny rings around their bodies…

He showed with his hands. And the music started playing.

I hadn't heard this song before, and it struck me from the first second.

*Call her moonchild,*
*Dancing in the shallows of a river*
*Lovely moonchild,*
*Dreaming in the shadow of the willow…*

I noticed a hissing rhyme, "shallows" and "shadow", not at the end of the line, but in the middle. Just some kind of silver age of the poetry, serpentine perfection of form.

Then I fell into pleasant half-thoughts about nothing, and stopped following the text, and when the song ended and began psychedelia, difficult to distinguish from the sounds of furniture being moved, I fished out the last lines from memory, which flew by in real time:

*Playing hide and seek*
*with the ghosts of dawn*
*Waiting for a smile from a sun child*

It really was something incredibly beautiful and very old, much older than the sixties, when this song was written. Something antique, I thought. Not from our time in any way.

Probably, it was the corrupting influence of Frank, after his words, I just couldn't hear this song any other way. Even my resentment for the ruined evening has passed.

"Yes," I said, "you're right. It's from another world. Some kind of ancient fairy tale."

"Not a fairy tale. It's actually an echo. That's exactly what I was talking about – a lost echo that has forgotten its source."

"Echo of what?"

He looked at me condescendingly.

"This is the story of Caracalla. His whole life, condensed to a few lines."

"How do you know?"

"I know. I can tell you everything about him. Well, not everything, but the most important thing. It's enough for you to understand what this song is about."

"Tell me," I asked.

I was really interested.

"I will," he said, "Only I need to a bathroom."

Judging by the fact that all the taps were purring at once, he had something with his stomach, and he did not want to embarrass me with sounds.

In fact, a human is a very complex device with a lot of physiological functions. He is not well suited for the seduction ritual that Hollywood dictates to us…

I didn't think much of this idea, because I noticed on the bedside table near the bed some kind of curved, dimly gleaming object. I didn't notice Frank put it there.

It was a mask made of a metal dark of time, pasted on the inside with soft velvet so as not to scratch the skin. On its forehead was a black stone in a frame. Not precious one, but something like a piece of basalt. Above the stone were small horns. Then I realized that these were not horns, but a crescent moon turned up with its points. Mask of the Moon.

It was leaving nose and mouth open, and was very beautiful: thin, lightweight enough, with an unobtrusive ornament along the edge. I immediately wanted to put it on.

And I did exactly that. The mask had comfortable straps covering the back of my head and holding it on my face. Then Frank came out of the bathroom. I was afraid that he would scold me, but he smiled contentedly. Apparently, he liked my arbitrariness.

"Is that a mask of the Moon?"

"Yes," Frank said, "It suits you. You asked me what I rely on as a historian. Exactly on this."

"Where did you get it?"

He twirled his hand in the air. Probably, I thought, out of the air. Well, if he wants to, he'll tell.

"It's beautiful."

"This is a real antique mask," he said.

"What metal is this? Silver?"

"Electron. An alloy of silver and gold."

"Probably expensive."

He grinned.

"If I wanted to impress an American girl, I would say that it can be exchanged for a new Ferrari. But I'll tell you the truth – it can be exchanged for a Tesla. And there will still be left."

I have already learned to recognize the moments when he jokes, and laughed.

"No, really. How much does it cost?"

"It's priceless. It has no price. There is nothing to compare with. I think it can easily be sold for millions."

"So," I replied, "you're seriously investing in your schizophrenia. I respect that."

A grimace of almost pain appeared on his face.

"Don't spoil it with sarcasm," he asked.

Indeed, the jokes were destroying the magical mysterious atmosphere that we had been creating all the evening. I finally decided to look at myself in the mirror.

What I saw startled me and scared me.

A goddess was looking out of the mirror.

An ancient goddess whose beautiful face promised bliss and terror. It was something real and scary. I remember thinking right away that this mask has a soul. Or rather, soul and body, and if the body consisted of an alloy of gold and silver, then the soul was made of an alloy of delight and death.

It occurred to me that the mask must have been used in rituals, and those slanting slits of the eyes saw a lot of things that are not compatible with life. Maybe it was worn on sacrificed people... or, the opposite, on the priestess who was making the sacrifice… It was as if we had woken up some creepy piece of the past for a moment, and it looked at me from the hotel mirror.

I turned to Frank to share my feelings, and even screamed.

He was wearing a different mask, very similar to mine, only with metal rays like the thorns of the Statue of Liberty. The mask of the Sun, I realized.

"You put it on yourself," he said, "And that's good. If you want to listen about Caracalla, it should be on you… Lie down on your back to make it comfortable. It's a long story."

"Okay", I agreed.

"I will speak in the first person. And don't interrupt. As soon as you interrupt, I will stop."

"And what if I fall asleep?"

"Then you will fall asleep."

"Okay," I said.

"I liked the god Mithra the most," he said in the same tone, and I didn't even realize at first that his story had already begun. "Since the childhood, only him…"
