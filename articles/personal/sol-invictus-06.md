# Chapter 6

It was hot in Istanbul.
That was the first thing I noticed.
The second thing I noticed was a mustachioed, emaciated Turk who looked like Freddie Mercury, who conquered the flesh by fasting and prayer. As proof of his spiritual feat, he held a sign with the word "Alexandra" in his hands.
–My name is Mehmet," he said in Russian. – Hello, Alexandra.
–Sasha," I corrected. – Hello. Are you my guide?
He nodded.
– The car is waiting for us.
The car turned out to be a gray Mercedes – an elderly and, as they say about tanned playboys, a well-aged gelding. The driver looked like his car. He was gray-haired and old, but he radiated a good mood even with a cropped bull's head.
"I'll take you to the hotel," Mehmet said, "so that you can rest from the flight.
I wanted to say that I wasn't particularly tired of him – but I decided to take a shower and change clothes for the Istanbul climate.
Mehmet carefully told the local political news (bad people muddy the waters, you don't have to believe everything you write – as if someone else believes something today), and I looked out the window at Asia pretending to be Europe.
Asia nowadays pretends to be Europe so well that it turns out better than Europe itself, which mostly pretends to be North Africa. But many things in Asia cannot be covered up with any makeup: olive tones, this ancient dust. These faces. Well, politics, probably – after all, if you look at it, it's always just a function of the climate. Oppressed by the sun. It's not for nothing that Mehmet mumbles about it all the way.
It often happens to me that some place in a strange city suddenly seems familiar. The same thing happened here: already in the center of Istanbul, I looked out of the car window, and it seemed to me that we were in Moscow – not far from the Kremlin, on one of the old streets. It was a strange and painful feeling. It was as if I had known by heart all the local cafes and doorways since childhood, where my life had passed…
But it wasn't the Moscow I came from, but the version of it that you sometimes see in a dream. One of the options, let's say. In this other Moscow there was a semblance of Bolshaya Nikitskaya, where Konstantin's column stood halfway from Tverskoy Boulevard to the Kremlin.
I later found out that once this column was covered with gold and stuck out in the center of a huge empty square, about like the Admiralty Pillar in front of the Winter Palace. And when the Turks took Constantinople, the terrified residents gathered around the column hoping that they were about to be saved by the angel promised by the Orthodox leadership. The story is politically correct about what happened to them next. But the angel most likely did not appear, otherwise the priests would remind about it every day.
I liked the hotel. She was in the historical center. And even its architecture turned out to be purely Istanbul, in the sense that there were several of these architectures at once.
We entered the old courtyard, approached the complex intersection of geometric shapes formed by overlapping walls of different eras and styles (it was not even clear which of the buildings we were entering through each other), opened a heavy door – and entered a corridor with lamps hidden in mirrors, air conditioning and a friendly moustache in the a white uniform behind the counter. It was like a cave hidden in shapeless rocks from the "Thousand and One Nights".
And also like Hagia Sophia, similarly hidden by architectural shells and polyps growing on it - I thought this when I saw a picture of the cathedral above the reception.
Hagia Sophia – though not so big – was on the wall in the Moscow coffee shop "Istanbul". And in Istanbul itself, she met me at a hotel. If you need a new sign, here.
I made an appointment with Mehmet right at the counter about tomorrow's excursion to the cathedral and let him go. It's nice to give a mustachioed testosterone man ten euros for a tip. It's like being filmed in a progressive advertisement for "New Balance" sneakers. I mean the new balance of power on the planet.
My room turned out to be small (the center is the center), but cute. There was a large mirror on the wall, and in the middle of it was like a window into a tropical paradise: a distant sandy beach, palm trees and the incoming sea.
Here it is, a reflection of your exclusive soul, as the institution would say… And it's just a TV disguised in a mirror, an inner voice added. I haven't seen this before. Somehow too symbolic.
In fact, I was pretty tired, but I decided that I would still take a walk towards Hagia Sophia. Tomorrow I had to go there with a guide and "understand everything", and today I wanted to look at the building with my own naive eyes. A sign is a sign.
How many times have I heard about this cathedral. And now it's five minutes on foot... I took a shower, put on a long blue dress (at first I wanted to wear black, but it was short and looked a little unascetic, let's just say – and I still went to the temple), put a folded cotton scarf in my bag (just in case) and went outside.
Having found out the direction, I swam through the evening Istanbul, but after a few steps I realized that Sofia would wait.
I was terribly hungry – and I sat down at the first restaurant table on the street. Five minutes later, I was enthusiastically dipping freshly baked pita bread into some incredibly delicious local dip.
I had a strange feeling that I wasn't alone.
I know how it sounds, but I don't mean people. It seemed to me that there were many, many van Gogh eyes looking at me in the dark sky above me, and I could hardly resist winking at them all.
In general, I was late for the cathedral – and after dinner, I went to the hotel.
At night I dreamed that I was still going to Sofia. I realized sometimes that I was dreaming, but I immediately forgot. During the whole trip I never saw the cathedral itself – at first it was obscured by architectural corals, then it hung directly over my head with an expressionless vertical wall, and then I was already inside.
It was half dark there, candles were burning and a distant church choir was singing (most likely, an audio recording behind the altar, I wisely thought in a dream). Not knowing where I was going, I wandered up the narrow and dimly lit corridor. The higher I climbed, the brighter and colder it became around, and it surprised me – the cold air should go down. Then I remembered that I was sleeping and the air conditioner was working on me. And again I forgot.
Something sparkled ahead.
It was a large golden bird–a peacock studded with gems and stones with a huge tail like a moth-eaten round silk carpet. The peacock was made very skillfully – and, although it bore many rough marks of time, I was amazed at its beauty. And then I finally woke up.
I lay on my back for a while, remembering my dream. Everything was clear with the golden bird: I had read about mechanical peacocks standing on the sides of the Byzantine throne – it seems that Alexei Tolstoy in Peter the Great and somewhere else… I wonder if that was a sign too? Or do you just have such dreams in Istanbul?
The next morning I had breakfast at the hotel, and then Mehmet met me. I still put on a black dress, and immediately felt that the guide did not approve of my choice. But he didn't say anything.
Sofia was not like in my dream. I could not even imagine its huge internal volume, this bubble of antique emptiness trapped by masonry. I dreamed of something smoky and stuffy, and the real Sofia was… I don't know how to describe it–full of cool ancient dignity. Alive. Strange. Not at all like the current temples. Or maybe it was a temple of another religion that has long been forgotten.
Mehmet took me from fresco to fresco and repeated the memorized Russian passage at each one – it was clear that he did this often and no longer pondered the meaning of the words he uttered.
At first it was interesting and informative to listen to him – the masonry of the eighth century, the masonry of the tenth, secret doors to a secret dead end, and so on. I especially liked his impersonation of the Slavic prince in front of the Byzantine image of the Mother of God – it oozed with such a subtle and even offensive understanding of the subject for the Russian heart that I asked if he had watched Andrei Rublev (it turned out he had watched it when he studied in Moscow).
My information buffer overflowed, I wanted to wander alone, and I let Mehmet go until tomorrow.
I wanted to find that upper corridor where the golden peacock stood. There was nothing like it anywhere, but I was sure that my dream had some kind of counterpoint in reality. Something symbolically close, let's say. And I really found a gallery on the second floor (where I went up the most ordinary stairs). The similarity was mainly in the lighting.
Peacock, of course, was not there. But I saw a stand with drawings of Hagia Sophia in different historical epochs. In front of him stood an elderly, but slender and youthful woman with a short gray haircut.
Or rather, a lady.
Here this word just suggested itself: she was dressed in everything dark and inconspicuous, but her skirt, jacket, suede shoes, silk T-shirt under the jacket and a black scarf pulled down from her head to her shoulders looked immaculate. She wasn't wearing any jewelry at all. This lady interested me even more than the pictures on the stand, but I still didn't understand what was going on.
There is such a cliche – they say that some people have a special aura that immediately attracts attention to them, inspires respect, and so on. No one knows what an aura is. Most likely, the following happens: the brain processes the sum of the signals coming into it and gives a verdict – there is something here that I can't decipher, so it's better not to be rude, Sasha.
Like I was going to.
I probably looked at the lady for too long – she noticed and smiled. I smiled back.
She had a kind and intelligent face, lively eyes–and if I had to guess three times what she was doing, I would have assumed that she was a very expensive psychoanalyst, a top real estate agent or the widow of some billionaire. A widow, because she's all in the dark. He still can't forget his grief.
Are you probably from Russia? "What is it?" she asked in Russian.
–Yes,– I said. "Did you guess that from the way I stared at you?"
– No, not only. I usually see where a person comes from. Does it annoy you if they recognize you as Russian?
"Not at all,– I replied. – I just don't like when the stealth mode is violated.
– I understand, – she said. "I'm sorry my radar picked you up. But you also discovered me in space.
We laughed. I already felt sympathy for her.
– What's your name? "What is it?" she asked.
– Sasha.
- OK. And I'm with. My full name is Sophia, but I was only called that in Of Russia. And that was a long time ago.
– Sophia?  I asked. – What is your name, what is this mosque?
– In general, yes, we are namesakes. That's why I come back here often. It even seems to me sometimes that this is my home.
– If I'm not mistaken, – I said, – the name of the temple in translation means "the wisdom of God."
–Yes,– So nodded. – And this is not the same as human wisdom at all. The Gnostics believed that Sophia was one of the highest manifestations of the divine principle. There is the creator of our world, and she is the creator of the creator.
"I read about it,– I said. – Our God is like Frankenstein from a failed abortion, and this Frankenstein has us like tin soldiers, in which he plays…
She made a face as if something bitter had got into her mouth. And then she swallowed it.
Sasha, express yourself culturally, I reminded myself. You're in the temple.
–It's just not clear why Sofia is a woman," I continued. – Why "she"? After all, this is a disembodied spirit. Of course, I am pleased as a feminist, but my Turk told me that Christians then identified Sofia with Christ. Such a Patriarchate of Constantinople...
is your Turk?  So frowned. – Are you married?
–No," I said. – My guide. Mehmet. I've already let him go.
–Thank God,– she said. – Don't marry a Turk. Otherwise you'll become like this church.
It's good that my good Mehmet has already left – it would have offended him.
– By the way, there are a lot of Sofias in Russia," I said. – I mean, cathedrals with that name. And everywhere someone checked in. Or Tatars, or Oprichniks. Either the Communists or Tarkovsky.
Yes," she agreed. – This is the essence of our story.
"My mother told me," I began, already feeling that I was talking absurdity, but unable to slow down, "the Soviet government was called "Sofya Vlasyevna." Well, by the first letters. And also because she kind of dragged everyone by the hair. Is there a connection with Sofia?
– Which one?
That's why I blurted it out?
"I mean, we were the third Rome," I stammered. – And here the second ... took, so to speak, the baton. Until you arrive, you won't understand…
I
was driving to the hotel yesterday," I finally found myself, "and I saw Konstantin's column. And it seemed to me... no, it didn't seem to me, but I felt one hundred percent that it was Moscow next to the Kremlin.
"I understand now," So smiled. – Indeed, there is a long-standing connection between these Orthodox capitals. The same energy that a person vaguely feels. Because of this, deja vu arises.
She pronounced "deja vu" with a French
pronunciation. – And you're partly right about Sofia Vlasyevna. The Soviet government was also the wisdom of God. Only fake. Made, as Soviet satirists wrote, on Malaya Arnautskaya Street. Very similar to the truth, but not quite. And in the end, it's not true at all and there's a lot of blood... why did you come here?
This question didn't strike me as rude or intrusive. And I decided to answer it honestly.
– I'm traveling. I'm going there, I don't know where, I'm looking for something, I don't know what. I'm going to visit God.
So laughed.
– I like it. Are you serious?
"I've been dreaming about this for a long time," I said. – At every young… Well, a relatively young human being should have such a sacred magical journey at least once in his life.
Do you want to find something?
"I don't know," I said. – I obey the signs. Instructions from above.
- Yes? And how do you get them?
I shrugged.
– I just realize at some point that I received an instruction. And if possible, I follow it. That's exactly how I came here, for example. I received an instruction in a dream.
She looked at me with amused disbelief.
"So you don't know what you're looking for at all?"
- no.
– Maybe knowledge? Wisdom?
– Maybe.
"Then you're wasting your time here," So said. – The old wisdom is already dead.
- why?
– To understand this, you need to see the action of time.
She said "to see the action of time" in a special tone, as if it was about some very specific procedure.
"Don't I see him?"  I asked. – Yes, every day. Here in the mirror, for example.
"All living things change,– So replied. – But I'm talking about something else. I'm talking about the effect of time on something that, in theory, should not change.
She nodded at the shield with images of the cathedral in different eras.
– Look at this blue house…
The drawing she had in mind was signed "the cathedral under Justinian immediately after construction." The building on it really looked bluish. No late additions, minarets, alterations – everything was strict and clean. And strangely familiar. It seemed to me again that I had seen something similar in Moscow: either a planetarium, or a metro station, or some project from the thirties.
"The building has changed, of course," So said. – It can be seen from the pictures – this is the sixth century, this is the tenth, this is the twelfth. Houses age like people. But this ideal Sofia, which was built by Justinian – did it remain the same as in the sixth century?
"I don't understand," I replied.
–Your picture when you were sixteen. Over time, it turns yellow, fades. Paper is getting old. But what is depicted on it, you are in your youth – is this changing or not? The way you were at sixteen – will it be the same when you're thirty and when you're sixty? Or in a thousand years?
"I guess," I said, "it's always going to be the same." Because it is… Well, for example, like the weather on the ninth of April last year. It will always remain the weather of the ninth of April.
Not really," So sighed. – And that's the main problem. If the world gets very hot, it will turn out that on the ninth of April last year it was cold in it. And if it gets very cold, it turns out that it was hot. All our estimates are comparative. You see Sofia in the portrait of her youth, but those times have already passed. You're looking at this building from the heights… Or rather, from the depths of what has happened over the past fifteen hundred years. It seems to you that this is an antediluvian Soviet design. Some kind of movie theater "Drummer" on steroids… Moreover, this "Drummer" now has a restaurant, a brothel and a casino.
She hit the nail on the head–I finally realized what exactly this drawing resembled.
"But look at the blue domed house again," So continued. – And try to see him through the eyes of a sixth-century Romeian girl. Rome has fallen, the rectangles of the former temples are being crushed by the hammer of history, but there is a new Rome, and in it there is a new temple, not like the former ones… All this can still be experienced here. Try.
Probably, it was the words "rectangles of former temples". Indeed, I thought, they used to be assembled from rectangles and triangles. The golden ratio, straight lines, Pythagorean trousers, to which antiquity prayed. And here is a miracle with domes, a stone hill, a wave…
And suddenly I realized what Sofia was to Romey: an absolute avant-garde, a ticket to the future, a promise that a happy and free age of salvation had finally arrived. I saw what this building looked like when it was the newest one built on Earth.
I didn't think of it, but I saw it – albeit very shakily, at the very edge of perception. The blue house, like a cloud of incense smoke, rounded windows crossed with double crosses, a smooth pile of domes and arches – all this has become an insanely bold futuristic design.
I realized what it was like to stand under these walls in the sixth century and see the impossible tomorrow. Something like this would be possible today to admire the architecture of a breakthrough somewhere in Shanghai or Tokyo - if it was inspired by something else besides the hope of getting some money.
What I saw in the drawing did not change completely in that second. The way I saw it changed. Yes, it was amazing…
I tried to tell in a nutshell about my experience.
–Good girl,– So smiled. "That's what I'm talking about.
–That's weird," I said. – The time when Byzantium existed is called the Dark Ages... and in Sofia had such a light and joyful light…
Dark times is an invention of the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries. To create an age of Enlightenment, you need to invent an age of darkness.
– Are you a historian?  I asked.
– In the past.
– So there were no dark ages?
– Of course not. There is always darkness and light – in any era, in any place where people live. Our concepts of history are graffiti spray on ruins. We only see what we have painted on top of the ruins. We do not have any wisdom that has come from the ages. The truths completely change their meaning and taste, although all the tablets seem to be in place... the divine revelation fades along with the words. And then a new century comes and leaves another brazen painting on top of the ruins. Wisdom was in this world. She lived in this temple. But now she has disappeared without a trace. Every age has to look for it anew, and every person too... One wisdom for the young, another wisdom for the old…
Her face looked for a second like one of the sad ancient frescoes that Mehmet showed me. And then she smiled, and her cheerful youthfulness immediately returned to her.
– What are your plans for today? "What is it?" she asked. – The day is just beginning.
– Nothing. The next tour is tomorrow. Mehmet will come to my hotel at eleven, and we will go to the racetrack. I mean, to the Roman hippodrome. But I can skip it.
Let's go visit me," So said. – There are a lot of young people there. The same girls and boys. Your colleagues.
– What do you mean, colleagues?
– They're also looking for I don't know what. Only by a different method. You'll be interested, I promise. You'll have lunch at the same time.
