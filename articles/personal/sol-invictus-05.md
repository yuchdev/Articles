# Chapter 5

I knew what the crow was hinting at.
A few hours before that, I was jumping on the Internet using links, having already forgotten what, in fact, I was starting to look for – and suddenly I was struck by the name of the fairy tale that popped up on the page of the art catalog.
 
GO THERE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE, FIND SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
 
This is the program of my trip, I thought. The problem is not only with where to go, but also with what to look for there. I laughed, promised myself that I would definitely find this fairy tale in the evening, and immediately forgot about everything.
And the crow reminded me.
No, everything is clear. I didn't really forget, but just moved the information to a subconscious buffer, and the crow's cry worked as a trigger. We know. The crow did not give me any signs, she was not talking to me at all, but to a fox from the FSB, who was interested in wholesale supplies of parmesan from fraternal Belarus, and so on. It is not difficult to explain all this by destroying the element of the miraculous. It is difficult to survive such an event as a miracle. And I succeeded.
The crow said – finally read the fairy tale, you fool.
I immediately found it on the Internet and read it.
In general, one Sagittarius wanted to kill a bird (again a bird!). Instead, she became his magical wife and forced Sagittarius to undergo magical tests, mobilizing the king there to help her. The first two tests were so–so - a journey to the next world and catching a talking cat with the help of three iron caps. Business as usual. But the third task was already serious – the same "go there, I don't know where, find something, I don't know what."
"I don't know where" turned out to be a space beyond the fiery river, where the hero was transported by an overgrown frog, and "I don't know what" – by a certain entity named "swat Naum". This very "matchmaker Naum" was just waiting for an opportunity to leave the former owner, some "peasant with a fingernail, a beard with an elbow" (I imagined a little harmful Che Guevara). Then "swat Naum" helped the hero to acquire a magical weapon, robbing innocent merchants along the way (heist was tacitly approved by the people's soul), and then the hero returned to his magical wife, killed the tsar, took his place and began to live in the palace, poking his bayonet into paintings and recovering in vases.
In general, the whole Propp and Kropotkin in one bottle. "Morphology of the Russian liberation fairy tale" plus AUE and "Life for Thieves". It is not surprising that with such scripts embedded in the mind ... However, do not panic – modern children have already been safely transferred to transgender Disney.
I also thought that "swat Nahum" was a distorted "Holy Nahum" or "Light On the Mind". And the unsuccessful killing of a bird with its subsequent transformation into a magical wife generally invited me to such curly alleys of the people's mind that without an escort of heavily armed feminists, I would not have gone there.
In general, the fairy tale delivered, but in a practical sense, I did not draw any conclusions. Jump on a giant frog over a fiery river. Well, yes, we will remember – and we will repeat it on occasion.
And then events began to develop rapidly.
In the evening Antosha came to me. Well-smoked and all so existential. He said that he had finally created something "quite brilliant." I got ready to listen to his music again and nod intelligently – but it turned out to be a text.
A new "Japanese passage," as he reported with a characteristic tetrahydrocannabinol giggle.
All right," I said, "leave it to read.
– No, – said Antosha, – you read it now. Right now.
– What, entirely?
– There are two pages in total…
And he handed me these very two pages, already decently gripped with his fingers – apparently, he had been sharing them with his colleagues all day.
I began to read.
IVAN MONOGATARI
The tale of the island of Shikotan
Prince Ivan, an elderly master of the bow, came out on the porch and shot an arrow with a forked tip to the horizon.
A few days later, people in green stopped his palanquin in the forest. In the clearing in front of the palanquin sat a werewolf frog known in those places by the name of Kusuka-chan. It was said that she had once been the wife of three shoguns and twelve daimyo, but whether in this life or before, no one knew.
The werewolf frog held the arrow shot by the prince with sharp teeth growing in three rows – and had already managed to bite it in several places.
Seeing Prince Ivan, the frog said:
Hurry up and take me to the castle, Prince Ivan! You will kiss me and I will become a beautiful princess!
Prince Ivan smiled out of the corner of his mouth, looked up, slightly pulled the bow and said:
– What is beauty?
– How so? – the frog was amazed. – Are you hesitating?
– You see, my dear, – Prince Ivan replied, – when you comprehend the nature of the way, there is no need to turn talking frogs into beautiful princesses anymore ... and who am I to interfere with the flow of transformations?
And made a sign to the servants to go on.
However, he did not stop thinking about the meeting – and, returning to the castle, he put it this way:

SEEING CLEARLY WITHHELD

Twenty years with a talking frog.
The smell of chanel. Treason. Sadness.
Rome and Capri. Dogs. Girlfriends.
Masks. Poses. The last berth.
I'll whisper to her on the moon pillow:
"How powerless are empty words
To convey what the souls feel..."
And the frog will answer me: "Kwa..."
And then he will snore. It will get boring.
I'll tell her: "Listen, you,
Do you want to know what happens to a frog
When falling from a great height?
You cold sticky bastard,
Death sleeps in your black star,
I'll throw you in the window at midnight,
May you croak there in the dark!"
And the frog will get up in fright,
Wiping his stretched mouth,
And he will perform his deathly dance,
Looking ahead questioningly.
I'll tell her, "All right, you bastard,
In the corner behind the garbage pail
Stay, perhaps, for now,
We'll figure it out later.
Actually, I'm sorry, you bastard.
I love the way you look out the window
At the purple shadows of sunset.
Go to sleep, please. I don't care."
But the frog will jump under the bench,
Facebook will burn with bonfires,
And the psychologist will write her a certificate,
That she suffered from torment.
And the frog will ask the lawyer
Write everything mine on it,
Because I was kneading her belly,
Regularly disturbing her sleep.
And then I'll die. And a frog
Bury me in the moonlight.
And only a small room will remain,
Where everything will be as it used to be with me…

Having thrown the brush, he went into contemplation of the essence for a long time. Then he ordered them to rewrite in large signs and retired to improve in shooting.
And Kusuka-chan was soon caught by peasants, beaten with hoes and hoes and burned in a rice field as a witch.
There was a drawing from below – such innocent bell-flowers, a butterfly above them, and under the ground – a frog skeleton with its paws tucked up with a fallen crown and a broken arrow in its mouth.
No, I even liked it. From an abstract point of view, it's not bad at all, some trends and specific events of our mercantile age are accurately reflected. Moreover, individual lines give out the breath of a chamber, but talent.
But how, God forgive me, do you have to be an idiot to bring such bells – instead of a bouquet of roses – to your girlfriend, who, due to well-known physiological reasons, is regularly forced to take the pose of this frog during intimate communication?

doesn't he understand? Or does he understand, and on purpose? Maybe he considers himself a prince? A sky bow shooter? And then, what is this "write all my things on it"? Is this the small one? Or does he have something else hidden away?
I smiled, feeling a cold rage condense inside me. I felt like a big smart snake preparing to swallow an impudent rabbit. And I'm ashamed to admit, I liked it.
–Nothing,– I said. – It's fine. Especially pretty flowers. So cute. I can see how you were drawing with your tongue sticking out.
– I knew you'd like it. Do you have anything to eat?
No," I said. – Shall we go to dinner?
I nodded.
– That's great, – said Antosha and kissed me on the cheek. – It just struck Manchiz. Is it okay that I speak English to you?
– Nothing.
–Just let's get laid quick first," he said, and rubbed his cheek against mine. – I read somewhere, it's useful before eating. Relaxes smooth muscles.
Cute romantic.
"Come on," I agreed.
I didn't want to do this – but, firstly, I already knew that we were doing this for the last time, and secondly, I wondered to what extent this snake's anger could grow in me and how long I could hide it. So he came to the frog to get laid and eat... bunny. I mean, no, it was yesterday you were a bunny. Today, I'm sorry, you're already a rabbit.
During the quickie, I even moaned with pleasure – from the consciousness of what I would do with this rabbit today, and from how wonderfully I know how to hide my feelings.
Being a snake is pretty nice. It's much nicer than working for the patriarchy as a frog. If Antosha had looked into my soul, he would have changed his attitude to female orgasm forever.
In fact, I was so angry with him that I behaved much more temperamentally than usual – and in the end he rewarded me with a dreamy, broken sigh and a long kiss. That's good, rabbit. There will be something to remember when Mommy leaves.
Ten minutes later we left the house, got out of the yard and walked down the street. There were many, many cafes and restaurants. At first, I really planned to treat Antosha to a farewell dinner, but I was depressed by the need to talk for a long time. And in general to explain something to him.
Everything was decided in the most unexpected way – just like in a fairy tale.
I mean, literally.
I heard the song from the open door of a coffee shop – and made out the second half of the verse.
…as a hot river swim
on the volcanic rim…
Then either a saxophone or a synthesizer entered beautifully, but these words were enough – it was as if a light bulb was lit in my head.
Hot river. The edge of the volcano.
The frog jumped over what? Across the river of fire. Antosha explained everything about the frog. And this is the river. It just sounded off.
I stopped. Antosha also stopped and looked at me questioningly.
"So it's going to be like this," I said. – Go to another frog and let her feed you today. I need to sort out my feelings… Don't interrupt… Maybe I'll call you later. But I'm not sure. And let's not discuss anything. I really don't have the strength right now.
His eyes bulged. 
– And why...
– I can give it for dinner, – I interrupted. – Need to?
–No,– he said, "thank you."
Pride awoke in him. That's good.
– Bye, then. And don't follow me, okay? Happy hunting on Shikotan Island…
I kissed him on the cheek, turned around and walked into the coffee shop where a song about a hot river had just been playing.
I don't always act so decisively. But today was a special occasion. It was like in a phone game: a puzzle formed in the right combination suddenly lights up with a fabulous golden light, illuminates everything around, burns down – and something else appears on the screen.
The second miracle in a row. The second after the crow reminded me about the fairy tale.
The most striking thing is that these miracles did not stand out in any way from the usual everyday flow of events – but they were definitely miracles. Although I would hardly be able to prove their wonderfulness to someone else - to the same Antosha – I would hardly be able to.
I asked the bartender what he was playing.
"A flash drive," he replied melancholically.
I see. I asked to switch back two tracks – and when the song about the hot river started playing again, I sniffed it with a dizer.
It turned out to be Nick Mason, the drummer of Pink Floyd – his solo album from the eighty-first shaggy year. The song was called "Hot River" and it was really good. I immediately found the words online. Something about swimming on a volcanic river with vague sexual connotations. There were no clear hints in the text. But it didn't matter – the frog had already soared over the river. It remained to figure out where she should land.
I looked around the cafe. A military cadet was eating a cake with tea in the corner. In another, two aunts were arguing at a table by the window. On the wall was a panorama of a large city with a temple on a hill.
I turned to the bartender, opened my mouth to ask, but immediately realized from his face that it was time to order. I looked down at the window.
– Can I… Is this a cheesecake or with yogurt?
- With blueberry yogurt.
– Give me one, and tea. Is there a green one?
– There is.
I paid and picked up the saucer with my blueberry cake. Now it was possible to ask further questions.
– Excuse me, but what is this panorama?
–Istanbul," the bartender smiled. – If you noticed, that's what we're called. There, you see – this is St. Sophia.
I sat down at a table and ate my cake with pleasure. It was almost without excess sugar, but still a little fatty. But it's better than sugar anyway. I also liked the tea – Japanese sencha.
Interesting. But if a crow had immediately croaked "Istanbul"? And not a "fairy tale"?
Fool, I answered myself, first of all, it wasn't a crow that croaked "fairy tale" – and you recognized this word in her "kar-kar" because you read about a fairy tale online. You wouldn't have heard the word "Istanbul" for sure, because you didn't think about Istanbul. And secondly…
If it weren't for the fairy tale, you would still be working as a frog for Antosha. Wiped, like, a stretched mouth.
When you know where to go, it's easier to pack a bag than if you don't know at all. It is necessary to write this aphorism in golden letters into the treasury of human wisdom and hang it next to the unforgettable, eternal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
What you need to know about a trip to Turkey?
Let's see. So, a visa is not needed. There is no war with them yet – you can fly at least tomorrow. What would we do without you, the Internet – right, would wander in the same darkness where our grandmothers…
I called a familiar travel agency, and in fifteen minutes they organized a hotel for two weeks, a ticket (one way, I said, where to go next – I'll decide on the spot) and even a personal Russian-speaking guide to familiarize myself with antiquities. The guide was supposed to meet me at the airport.
And not so much that it's very expensive – I could have done it without Daddy. In theory, anyway.
