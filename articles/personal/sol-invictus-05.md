# Chapter 5

I knew what the crow was hinting at.

A few hours before that, I was jumping on the Internet links, having already forgotten what, in fact, I was starting to look for – and suddenly I was struck by the name of the fairy tale that popped up on the page of the art catalog.
 
GO THERE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE, FIND SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW THE NAME
 
This is the exact program of my trip, I thought. The problem is not only with where to go, but also with what to look for in there. I laughed, promised myself that I would definitely find this fairy tale in the evening, and immediately forgot about everything.

And the crow reminded me.

I mean, everything is clear. I didn't really forget, but just moved the information to a subconscious buffer, and the crow's cry worked as a trigger. We know. The crow did not give me any signs, she was not talking to me at all, but to a fox from the FSB, who was interested in wholesale supplies of parmesan from fraternal Belarus, and so on. It is not difficult to explain all this by destroying the element of the miraculous. It is difficult to experience such an event as a miracle. But I managed to.

The crow said: finally read the fairy tale, you fool.
I immediately found it on the Internet and read it.
In general, one knight wanted to kill a bird (again a bird!). Instead, she became his magical wife and forced the knight to undergo magical tests, mobilizing the local king to help him. The first two tests were so-so, the first one is a journey to the afterlife, and catching a talking cat with the help of three iron helmets. Business as usual. But the third task was already a serious matter – exactly this "go there, I don't know where, find something, I don't know the name."
"I don't know where" turned out to be a space beyond the fiery river, where the hero was transported by an overgrown frog, and "I don't know what" – by a certain entity named "matchmaker Naum". This very "matchmaker Naum" was just waiting for an opportunity to leave the former owner, some "bearded man of a fingernail size" (I imagined a little evil Che Guevara). Then "matchmaker Naum" helped the hero to acquire a magical weapon, robbing innocent merchants along the way (heist was unanimously approved by the proletariat), and then the hero returned to his magical wife, killed the Tsar, took his place and began to live in the palace, poking his bayonet into expensive paintings and shitting in ancient vases.

In two words, the cocktail of Lenin and Pushkin in one glass. "Morphology of the Russian revolutionary fairy tale" plus AUE and "Life for Thieves" [TODO:analog]. It is not surprising that with such a cultural script embedded in the people's mind...

I also thought that "Nahum" was in fact "Holy Prophet Nahum". And the unsuccessful killing of a bird with its subsequent transformation into a magical wife generally invited me to such curly alleys of the cultural subconscious that without an escort of heavily armed feminists, I would not have advanced there.

After all, the fairy tale was fun, but in a practical sense, I did not draw any conclusions. Jump on a giant frog over a fiery river. Well, yes, let us remember this, and repeat on the occasion, if necessary.

After that, events began to develop rapidly.

In the evening Antosha came to visit me. With the slight odour of weed and all so existential. He said that he had finally created something "quite brilliant." I got ready to listen to his music[TODO:muzlo] again and nod intelligently, but it turned out to be a text.

A new "Japanese passage," as he reported with a characteristic tetrahydrocannabinol giggle.

"All right," I said," leave it, I'll read later.

"No," said Antosha, "you read it now. Right now."

"What? Read entirely?"

"There are only two pages in total…"

And he handed me these very two pages, already with traces of fingerprints – apparently, he had been sharing them with his colleagues all day.

I began to read.

*IVAN MONOGATARI*

*The tale of the island of Shikotan*

*Prince Ivan, an elderly master of the bow, came out on the porch and shot an arrow with a forked tip into the horizon.*

*A few days later, people in green stopped his palanquin in the forest. In the clearing in front of the palanquin sat a werefrog known in those places by the name of Kusuka-Chan. It was said that she had once been the wife of three shoguns and twelve daimyo, but whether in this life or another, no one really knew.*

*The werefrog held the arrow shot by the prince with sharp teeth growing in three rows, and already managed to break it in several places.*

*Seeing Prince Ivan, the frog said:*

*Hurry up, take me to the castle, Prince Ivan! You will kiss me and I become a beautiful princess!*

*Prince Ivan smiled with the corner of his mouth, looked up, slightly pulled the bow and said:*

*"What is beauty?"*

*"How so?" the frog asked in disbelief, "Are you hesitating?"*

*"You see, my dear," Prince Ivan replied, "when you comprehend the nature of the way, there is no need to turn talking frogs into beautiful princesses anymore... and who am I to interfere with the flow of transformations?"*

*And made a sign to the servants to go on.*

*However, he did not stop thinking about the meeting, and, returning to the castle, he put it this way:[TODO]*

*SEEING CLEARLY WITHHELD*

*Twenty years with a talking frog.
The smell of chanel. Treason. Sadness.
Rome and Capri. Dogs. Girlfriends.
Masks. Poses. The last berth.
I'll whisper to her on the moon pillow:
"How powerless are empty words
To convey what the souls feel..."
And the frog will answer me: "Kwa..."
And then she will snore. It will get boring.
I'll tell her: "Listen, you,
Do you want to know what happens to a frog
When she's falling from a great height?
You cold and sticky bastard,
Death sleeps in your black star,
I'll throw you in the window at midnight,
May you croak there in the dark!"
And the frog will get up in fright,
Wiping his stretched mouth,
And she will perform his deathly dance,
Looking ahead questioningly.
I'll tell her, "All right, you bastard,
In the corner behind the garbage pail
Stay, perhaps, for now,
We'll figure it out later.
Actually, I'm sorry.
I love the way you look out the window
At the purple shadows of sunset.
Go to sleep, please. I don't care."
But the frog will jump under the bench,
Facebook will burn with bonfires,
And the psychologist will write her a certificate,
That she suffered from torment.
And the frog will ask the lawyer
Write everything mine on it,
Because I was kneading her belly,
Regularly disturbing her sleep.
And then I'll die. And a frog
Bury me in the moonlight.
And only a small room will remain,
Where everything will be as it used to be with me…*

*Having thrown the brush, he went into contemplation of the essence for a long time. Then he ordered them to rewrite in large signs and retired to improve in shooting.*

*And Kusuka-chan was soon caught by peasants, beaten with shovels and hoes, and burned in a rice field as a witch.*

There was a drawing from below – such innocent bell-flowers, a butterfly above them, and under the ground – a frog skeleton with its paws tucked up with a fallen crown and a broken arrow in its mouth.

I would say, I even liked it. From an abstract point of view, it's not bad at all, some trends and specific events of our mercantile age are accurately reflected. Moreover, individual lines give out the breath of a chamber talent.

But how, God forgive me, do you have to be an idiot to bring such bell-flowers, instead of a bouquet of roses, to your girlfriend, who, due to well-known physiological reasons, is regularly forced to take the pose of this frog during intimate communication?

Doesn't he understand? Or does he, and do it on purpose? Maybe he considers himself a prince? A bow master? And then, what is this "write all my things on it"[TODO:]? Does he mean his certain small friend? Or does he have something else hidden away?

I smiled, feeling how a cold rage is condensing inside me. I felt like a big smart snake preparing to swallow an impudent rabbit. And I'm ashamed to admit, I liked it.

"It's okay," I said. "Fine. Especially these pretty flowers. So cute. I can almost see how you were drawing them with your tongue sticking out."

"I knew you'd like it. D'you have anything to eat?"

"No," I said. "Shall we go and have dinner?"

"I don't have cash [TODO:synonym] with me. Will you pay?"

I nodded.

"That's just great," said Antosha and kissed me on the cheek. "It just struck Manchiz. [TODO:slang] Maybe, let's have a quickie first?" he asked, and rubbed his cheek against mine, "I read somewhere, it's good for health before eating. Relaxes smooth muscles."

Such a cute romantic he is!

"Come on," I agreed.

"I didn't really want to do this – but, firstly, I already knew that we were doing this for the last time, and secondly, I wondered to what extent this snake's anger could grow in me and how long I could hide it. So he came to the frog to get laid and being fed... my sweet bunny. I mean, no, it was yesterday when you were a bunny. Today, I'm sorry, you're already a rabbit.

During the quickie, I even moaned with pleasure, imagining what would I do with this rabbit today, and from how experienced I am in hiding my feelings.

Being a snake is just wonderful. It's much nicer than working for the patriarchy as a frog. If Antosha had looked inside my soul at this moment, he would have changed his attitude to female orgasm forever.

In fact, I was so angry with him that I behaved much more temperamentally than usual, and in the end he rewarded me with a dreamy, deep sigh, and a long kiss. That's good, rabbit. You will have some sweet memories when Mommy would leave.

Ten minutes later we left the house, got out of the yard and walked down the street. There were many, many cafes and restaurants. At first, I really planned to treat Antosha with a farewell dinner, but I was upset by the need to have a long talk. And in general to explain anything to him.

Everything was decided in the most unexpected way, just like in a fairy tale.

I mean, literally.

I heard the song from the open door of a coffee shop, and caught the second half of the verse.

*…as a hot river swim*
*on the volcanic rim…*

Then either a saxophone or a synthesizer entered beautifully, but these words were enough – it was as if a light bulb was lit in my mind.

Hot fiery river. The edge of the volcano.

The frog jumped over what? Across the river of fire. Antosha explained everything about the frog. And here's the river. It just rang out.

I stopped. Antosha also stopped and looked at me questioningly.

"Linten now. The dinner is going to be like this," I said. "Go to another frog and let her feed you today. I need to sort out my feelings… Don't interrupt… Maybe I'll call you later. But I'm not sure. And let's not discuss anything. I really don't have the strength right now."

His eyes bulged. He certainly did not expect anything like that.

"But why..."

"I can give you to pay for dinner," I interrupted. "Do you need?"

"No," he said, "thank you."

Self-esteem suddenly woke up. That's good.

"Bye, then. And don't follow me, okay? Happy hunting on Shikotan Island…"

I kissed him on the cheek, turned around and walked into the coffee shop where a song about a hot river had just been playing.

I don't always act so firmly. But today was a special occasion. It was like in a smartphone game: a puzzle formed in the right combination suddenly lights up with a fabulous golden light, illuminates everything around, burns down – and them something else appears on the screen.

The second miracle in a row. The second after the crow reminded me about the there-where.

The most striking thing is that these miracles did not stand out in any way from the usual everyday flow of events, but they were definitely miracles. Although I would hardly be able to prove their wonderfulness to someone else, for example, to the very same Antosha, I would hardly be able to.

I asked the bartender what he was playing.

"A flash drive," he replied melancholically.

I see. I asked to switch two tracks back, and when the song about the hot river started playing again, I recognized it with a Deezer.

It turned out to be Nick Mason, the drummer of Pink Floyd, his solo album from the far past 1981 year. The song was called "Hot River" and it was really good. I immediately found the lyrics online. Something about swimming on a volcanic river with vague sexual connotations. There were no clear hints in the text. But it didn't matter – the frog had already soared over the river. It only remained to figure out where she should land.

I looked around the cafe. A military cadet was eating a cake with tea in the corner. In another, two ladies were arguing about something. On the wall was a panorama of a large city with a temple on a hill.

I turned to the bartender, opened my mouth to ask, but immediately realized from his face that it was time to nake an order. I looked down at the window.

"Can I… Is this a cheesecake or with yogurt?"

"With blueberry yogurt."

"Give me one, please, and the tea. Is there a green one?"

"There is."

I paid and picked up the saucer with my blueberry cake. Now it was appropriate to ask further questions.

"Excuse me, what is this panorama?"

"Istanbul," the bartender smiled. "If you noticed, that's our name. There, you see, this is St. Sophia Cathedral."

I sat down at a table and ate my cake with pleasure. It was almost without excess sugar, but still a little fat to my taste. But it's better than sugar anyway. I also liked the tea, a Japanese sencha.

That's interesting. But what if a crow had immediately croaked "Istanbul"? And not a "where-there"?

You stupid, I sweared to myself, first of all, it wasn't a crow that croaked "there", it were you who recognized this word in her "caw-caw" because you read about going there you don't know where. You wouldn't have heard the word "Istanbul" for sure, because you didn't think about Istanbul. And secondly...

If it weren't for the fairy tale, you would still be working as a frog for Antosha. Wiped, like, a stretched mouth.[TODO:quote]

When you know where to go, it's easier to pack a bag than if you don't know at all. It is necessary to write this aphorism in golden letters into the treasury of human wisdom and hang it next to the unforgettable, eternal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

What you need to know about a trip to Turkey?

Let's see. So, a visa is not required. There is no war with them yet, I can fly even tomorrow. What would we do without you, the Internet – probably, I would wander in the same darkness where our grandmothers did.

I called to an old friend who worked in a travel agency, and in fifteen minutes she organized a hotel booking for two weeks, a ticket (one way, I said, I'll decide on the spot where to go next) and even a personal guide to familiarize myself with antiquities. The guide was supposed to meet me at the airport.
And not that very expensive, I could have done it even without Daddy. In theory, anyway.
