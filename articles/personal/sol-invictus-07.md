# Chapter 7

So did not live in a hotel, but on a yacht – her own yacht, on which she sailed here. The yacht was moored at the Atakoy Marina. "I call her Saint Marina," she said with a smile, "so that Sofia would not be bored alone". During the time spent in the taxi, we finally switched to familiar terms, exchanged phones and emails, and I learned a lot about my new acquaintance.

She was the wife of an investor named Tim, who made good money on a couple of California startups ("just got lucky at roulette"). Now the family has already retired from business and sailed around the world on a boat, where they mainly lived ("like Robert Pirsig, only the boat is bigger. Have you read Pirsig's "Laila"? Although, I understand, a completely different generation ..."). They had children of my age, and they and their friends were also visiting on a yacht.

There were a lot of yachts on the Attack Marina – but they were all of moderate size, at most with a trailer for frozen meat (I don't know much about bourgeois boats, so my comparisons could be inelegant). Such funeral boats of the middle class. But one yacht turned out to be really huge.

It was strangely painted: all in multicolored vignettes and rosettes, with flowers and psychedelic ornaments-abstractions in the style of the sixties. Such a nostalgic revolutionary retro – "you can't buy the love, but you can sell it". It fitted the boat well.

"Tim liked John Lennon's Rolls-Royce," So said, "All his life he was dreaming of something like that, and when he bought a yacht, he decided to paint it like this car. Or rather, our son Michael convinced him. He would have been embarrassed himself.

"It turned out really nice," I replied, "When I saw I just wanted to go in and buy some weed."

So laughed.

"They'll definitely help you with that."

When we approached the yacht, I saw the name:

*AUrora*

Why, I thought, and immediately realized: "AU" is the designation of gold in the periodic table of elements. Moreover, one symbol was inscribed within another: "A" was an anarchist icon in a circle. Well, yes, the rich may cry too. Mostly from laughing at us.

And then I noticed a peacock tail with eyes painted on the stern. Almost the same as in my dream!

No, I definitely didn't come here by accident. This is it, my journey, I thought, and I felt so ease and comfortable.

I guessed right about the weed – its smell started to spread from the moment we stepped off the ladder onto the deck. The walls and doors around were painted in the same non-conformist-psychedelic style: Lennon's Rolls-Royce could well look like this from the inside.

We went down the stairs. Quiet indie music began to be heard. She opened the doors to a huge cabin (there was such a smell of weed here, as if we were in the epicenter of a forest fire) and said:

"Children! We have a guest!"

And then she turned to me, and made an inviting gesture.

"Children, this is my friend Sasha. Entertain her a little, and I'll go to see Daddy..."

So smiled reassuringly, and left me alone with six young people, looking expressionlessly in my direction from the blue smoky space.

A large, no, huge cabin, probably created by merging two or three rooms, was decorated as a typical bourgeois club, flirting with anarchist aesthetics: black stars and different types of letters "A" (Anarchist, Anti-Fascist and even a few Tibetan, I remembered how they look like). There were, however, also elements of self-irony.

On the ceiling, a huge ear was carved out with gold rivets, turned to the audience. Inside the ear was the yellow inscription made of same rivets:

*THE BIG OTHER IS LISTENING!*

On the wall hung a poster that immediately made me laugh: a young bearded man, a kind of a geek with indefinite sexual orientation in a black shirt with an anarchist insignia, looked at the viewer, clearly trying to look menacing. There was a signature on the bottom:

*Beware, Capitalism! I'm developing new anarchists emojis for the iPhone!*

The funny thing was that all four guys (there were also two girls here) looked very much like this geek from the poster: the same well-groomed pseudo-neglected beards, and one also had similar glasses.

"I'm Michael," said the bearded spectacled guy. "So is my maman. And this is my sweet Sarah."

Sarah was blonde, resembling a young Sinead O'Connor. Most likely, with a dyed hedgehog.

"These are friends. Rajiv, Andreas, May, Frank."

Those he called nodded and smiled at me.
Rajiv was a Hindu with a yellow-orange beard and a hidden malice in his eyes. Perhaps it seemed so because of the deep shadows around his eyelids. He had long, slender fingers pointing to refined ancient blood.

Andreas looked like a supporting actor from the TV show "Vikings". May looked like an actress from the same place. They looked older than the others.

Dark-haired Frank seemed to me the most handsome of all. There was a distinct criminal-soldier brutality in him, but in a civilized society it's just an element of personal design. It suits the men. There was something strange about his hairstyle, but I couldn't figure out what exactly.

I'm Sasha," I said. "Sasha from Russia. So and I, in fact, met not so long ago... We talked about architecture."

"Oh, she can do that," Michael said.

After five minutes, the awkwardness accompanying new acquaintances has completely gone. After another forty minutes I was already a bit high, and I already had a little idea who was who here and what they were preparing humanity for.

"We're not just anarchists, Sasha," Andreas was explaining, "We are corporate anarchists..."

"And what is it?" I asked.

"Well, it's like the last stage in the development of anarcho-capitalism. In fact, we are even anarcho-imperialists."

"Not everyone are corporate anarchists here," Sarah said, glancing at Andreas. "Some here consider them to be mere servants of the establishment."

"So what? Let it be, if you put it like that", Andreas replied, "We have a serious startup. We are realists and we are not fighting against the empire. We are modifying the elements of the system. And for this time we enter into a tactical alliance with its other elements."

"I don't really understand," I admitted.

"I'll explain," Sarah said. "Do you know why this emoji poster is hanging here? Because that's what they're going to do... corporate anarchists don't fight against evil. They make cool phone cases and covers for it, on which a politically correct attack on management is allowed. This makes the established order much stronger..."

I looked at the poster again. Although I understood every phrase of Sarah's, the general meaning eluded from me. But on the other hand, it eluded funnier and funnier.

"What does emoji have to do with it?"

"This is one of the tools of human enslavement."

"I don't understand again," I complained.

"Here it is, read it..."

Sarah gave me a self-made brochure, open on the centerfold. Part of the text was highlighted with a yellow marker. I read something like the following:

THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF EMOJIS

*Emoji is an attempt of the ruling oligarchy to move humanity even closer to the stall. Why does the emoji keyboard come out so intrusively on your mobile? Emojis provide much more convincing, fast and flattering ways of self-presentation than words. They are tempted to use them for intimate self-expression, although they do not express anything individual. They offer a person a fake reflection of his emotional state ("and I am like this"), which he likes more than the real one: a fake reflection is younger, cleaner, brighter, more glamorous – and the consumer is happy to delegate the rights of his micrography to the emoji. Emoji is a prosthetic selfie, behind which you can temporarily hide your nasty face. Emojis gradually take a person out of the second-signal cosmos and put him in the category of kawaii cats, controlled by emotionally charged symbols. Commands-words can be challenged with other words. However, it is impossible to challenge the emoji script, because it does not appeal to the mind, but to the sphere of emotions and sex. That's how our new masters plan to command us further. This method of human mechanization is a strategic preparation for the establishment of the dictatorship of artificial intelligence. The so-called "Enlightenment" continues, but at a new stage it takes away from a person the "dignity of a free mind", given to him once in order to kill God in himself. This process is going on in modern culture in many directions at once...*

By this point, I was tired of thinking about words, and there was not a single emoji here. I handed the brochure to Sarah.

"Keep it," Sarah said. – D'you understand? They're not going to fight it. They want to make money on it."

"How?" I asked.

"Have you seen the last Star Wars?"  Andreas asked.

I nodded.

"Do you remember, there was a monkey [TODO:check_out] who welded Kylo Ren's helmet with red seams? It was beautiful, isn't it? So we are such imperial welders. We don't think the First Order is a good thing. But this is the reality of today. Someone in our empire has to invent all this – helmets, axes, uniforms. So that even under the Sith oppression it was a little more fun to live. So that in the design of reality there remains, as it were, a hint of the possibility of an ordinary human happiness. For some backlash, optionality of the horror, temporary relaxation... The monkey with the welding that makes Kylo Ren's helmet a little more cool is not a rebel. He lives in the empire and remains completely loyal to it. Thanks to his help, however, Kylo Ren himself becomes a rebel. At the same time, he continues to lead the First Order and bomb the entire Galaxy, but when we look at his new helmet, we feel, how should I say it, a new hope.

"A New Hope..." I repeated.

"Yes, exactly. In the last century, the American cultural hero was *rebel without a cause*. And in the era of total surveillance, they can only be a *rebel without a cop*. Think for yourself, what kind of rebel with a smartphone? Well, he will set fire to a couple of garbage dumps, so they will film him from five corners and track through geolocation. Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that no one dares to pursue the rebel. And for that, his rebellion has to become more mainstream than the mainstream itself, you understand? It should be such that cops are kicked out of work for fighting the rebels..."

Sarah, apparently, guessed that the American cultural codes did not reach me well, and took pity.

"I'll explain it to you," she said. "The empire today is not the power of the state. This is the power of big corporations. State control is the last thing that somehow opposes them, so the aesthetics of anti-state anarchism will be in demand by these corporations. Perhaps even a direct revolt against the traditional central government will be in demand – but not against corporations and investment banks. Do you know who is in front of you? The litter of the most sinister branch of information capitalism, posing as fearless young heroes. A corrupt Marvel of the soul. Their main product is a romantic pose, completely cleansed of all that it implies. That is, from everything that made this pose romantic...

Andreas shuddered caricaturally at each of her phrases and made painful grimaces, as if bullets were hitting him one after another.

"And what exactly do they want to sell? What's the name," I asked.

Andreas opened his mouth, then feigned fright on his face, and pointed at Sarah.

"She won't let me say a word anyway. Let her explain herself."

Sarah didn't have to be asked twice.

"They want to sell *Desology* ", she said. – This word was invented, by the way, not by Andreas, but by Michael. Although you might as well call it an *Ideosign*.

"Desology sounds better," Andreas replied. It feels like disinformation and disguise. And at the same time as a science. Together we'll get a play.

"And what is it – Desology"?

"Ideology along with design,– Sarah said. – Design, which is an ideology. An ideology cunningly promoted through design. Kylo Ren's new helmet. In short, this is..."

And she nodded again at the anarchipster hanging on the wall.

"They want to develop an ideological design that will open the human heart, and then upload into this heart a cultural code useful for large corporations."

"Can you give an example of such a design?" I asked.

"I can. This is the yacht. It seems to promote the idea that in our world you can be a rebellious psychedelic romantic with a clear conscience, and the same time surf the seas on a boat for fifty million[TODO:slang]."

By the way, this is what came to my mind first when I saw the design of a yacht.

"And what kind of ideological design will big corporations buy?" I asked.

"Well, as usual. The freedom of any external supervision of their activities, presented to the consumer as a noble anarchism, an offshore commune, multiculturalism with ganja, freedom from police oppression and leftism... These are the anarcho-emojis for iPhone. This, of course, is vile. But it's not vile enough yet to convince investors.

"Why?" I asked with a little slurring my tongue, "It's quite vile enough. At least, at first glance."

I liked Sarah. I also liked Frank, but he hadn't said a word yet, he was just concentrating on making the joints[TODO:slang]. I wondered if May was his girlfriend? Or is one of the three guys his boyfriend?

"Meanness is only half the battle," Sarah replied, "Novelty is also needed. And there is nothing new here. Modern American culture is a corporate chameleon, for those not only nothing sacred exists, but rather anything can become sacred in fifteen minutes[TODO:rephrasing]. Andreas was half a century late. Perhaps he would have surprised John Lennon himself. But now... All ideological symbolism is stolen, appropriated and available in any cocktails. No one needs your startups here."

"But there is also a fresh element of design," Andreas objected listlessly.

I suddenly noticed Sarah's T-shirt. It was an ordinary white T-shirt with the word "Google" made up of multicolored letters that you usually see on the start page of a search engine. I noticed it right away, but only now I read the inscription correctly: "Goolag".

Well, well. Perhaps Sarah was the main inspiration for the project, despite her sarcastic criticism. Or probably, as it finally reached me[TODO:slang], such self-criticism was just an element of ideological design.

My new acquaintances have already forgotten about me. For ten minutes they discussed the concept of LGBTQIA+ friendly soft drink "Spride". Then they started talking about the long overdue transition from "Burning Man" to "Burning Woman", or even immediately to "Burning Person", to include and diversify everyone. Someone with a tear in his voice suggested "Burning Person of Color", but the idea was scrapped. The kind heartfelt message was clear, but historical allusions were discouraging.

"They'll take it for the Ku Klux Klan," Michael explained to me, "Dialectics of progress…"

I no longer understood what they were talking about.

"And what is this Burning Man?"

"Such a cultural event-selfiedrome," Sarah replied, "The meanest bourgeoisie of the planet gathers in the desert, a large plywood effigy of a man is set on fire in front of VIP tents, and corporate anarchists with imperial welders take romantic poses..."

I didn't ask any more questions, and Sarah started arguing furiously about something with Michael.

I remembered that Michael had called her "my sweet". It looked like they were lovers. Sarah definitely seemed cooler than her boyfriend. Five times like that. Maybe even seven, the smell of weed kept me constantly losing count.

Finally, Sarah took Michael by the hand and led him out of the cabin. After finishing the joint, Rajiv and May followed them.

"Where are they all going?" I asked.

"Probably playing ping-pong," Andreas chuckled, "Where else? Do you want some Dmitry?"

A small tube appeared in his hands. The question was addressed to Frank and me.

"Dmitry?" I asked, "What Dmitry?"

"We won't," Frank said and looked at me, "I don't recommend you smoking DMT. If you haven't tried it yet."

It was the first time I heard his voice. I shook my head, and Andreas got down to business without us. This stuff smelled like burning resin. Soon Andreas lay down on the floor and his spirit floated away somewhere in Valhalla.

"It's still cool," I told Frank, "Goolag, this anarchipster... well done. Witty."

"Just don't think they invented it all by themselves," Frank replied, "These are jokes from the Internet. The same age as us. The guys are trying to be inspired by them. Andreas himself has not invented anything yet, except the word "Spride" and the "Donald Dick" thermocup. You can guess with what design. However, the cup sold well in California. If you work for Big Tech, it's useful to have one on your desktop.

"Aren't you in their project?"

"No," Frank said, "I'm here on another matter. In fact, I just hitched a ride to Turkey. I know Tim and So. They sponsor my work."

"Are you an ideological designer too?"

"I'm a historian."

"An anarchist historian?" I asked.

He nodded.

"Probably. Just don't ask me what it is. I'll come up with it overnight, and tell you tomorrow."

Interesting. It meant we'd be together tomorrow. Suggestive pickup, no other way.

"Why did you come to Turkey?" I asked.

"I want to test one of my concepts."

"Historical one?"

"Yes. And why are you?"

"I'll tell you tomorrow," – I replied. "If I have time to come up with it overnight."

He laughed and pointed his index finger at me. A characteristic Latin American gesture, meaning something in between "a draw" and "next time I'll shoot you."

I liked Frank more and more. I thought he looked like a loser boxer. Although, on the other hand, what's good about loser boxers?

All the guys here were bearded, but there was a special testosterone persuasiveness in Frank's short and at the same time pseudo-neglected beard. I mean, in a good way: this is quite rare, but it happens.

His short curly hair smoothly turned into a beard, and curled into rings above his forehead. Everything seemed to look natural, and still something subtly strange shone through in such a haircut.

I decided to ask.

"What kind of hairstyle do you have? I have not seen such."

"You noticed, didn't you?"  he grinned.

"I noticed," I replied, "But I can't figure out what I noticed."

"No one understands," he said, "But everyone notices. I cut my hair exactly like Caracalla. By his bust."

At first I thought it was a rapper or a football player.

"Who is this?"

"Roman emperor of the third century AD. Then the hair was cut off differently than it is now. No hairdresser will do it. I do my haircut myself."

I remembered that there were baths of Caracalla in Rome.

"Oh, is that the one who built the baths?"

He nodded.

"And lots of other things."

Lying on the floor, Andreas suddenly made a grinding sound, as if he had stumbled upon an icy comet in the dark corners of his trip. I thought he had come to his senses, but he just turned over on his other side.

"And why do you cut your hair like a Caracalla?" I asked.

"It's my research method," Frank replied.

"How it is?"

"I'm not really an anarchist historian. I'm more of an empathic historian. More precisely, necroempathic.

I guess, I've been breathing the smoky air here for too long.

"Necroempathic," I repeated, "That's definitely the coolest thing I heard today. And what, I wonder, does this mean? The one I think?"

Frank laughed.

"Ordinary historians," he said, "try to understand the people who lived before through the documents of the epoch, culture, and so on. But it's like trying to understand a modern American through films about the Avengers or UN resolutions."

"Great method," I replied.

Frank shook his head.

"A person is never like his time. Just the opposite, he always hides from time to time in his personal secret. Like an oyster in the shell. He perceives his time as a catastrophe, and then, a thousand years later, someone digs up his skeleton, and this person begins to be judged by the flood from which he was running away. By the very monster from which a person has been hiding all his life."

"Do you want to understand the epoch in some other way?"

"I don't want to understand the epoch at all," he replied, "because it's impossible. Rather, any charlatan can do it in ten different ways, and each of them will be fake. The epoch cannot be understood."

"Why?"

"Because epochs do not exist. This is not something real and objective. It's a metaphor. Something fictional, invented by people. And how can you understand the fictional? Whatever you come up with, that's how it will be.

An interesting approach.

"Maybe," I said, "some people invent and others study. What the first ones came up with."

"That's right, it is. But I don't need their inventions."

"So what is "necroempathy"? Empathy for the dead?"

"It's when you try to understand some long-dead person by taking his form," Frank said, "And copying the circumstances of his life."

"And why do you think that it is possible to understand someone in this way?"

"It's a matter of belief," he smiled, "I believe that we leave a trace behind. A standing wave, as physicists say. A kind of echo. And if you tune in to this echo correctly, you can feel it and even relive it."

"Ah!" I said, "Ah! Now I understand. Do you want to tune in to this Caracalla?"

"That's right. I am studying the history of the Emperor Caracalla and trying to see him as if from within himself. Through empathy."

"Why did you come to Turkey? Caracalla was the emperor of Rome."

"Yes. But he spent a lot of time here. Like his father Septimius Severus."

"Why?"

Frank made a vague gesture with his hand, like explaining that it would take a long time to explain.

"He came here with a large army, and intended to invade Parthia. Parthia in general was a pet peeve for Rome. Caracalla simply continued his father's work."

"Yeah. And you're looking for traces?"

"Not really. I'm telling you, I'm an empath. I travel to the places where Caracalla lived, and gradually become himself. I see his story in the first person. He was such a Jihadi John – he came here to fight from Britain. If you want, I'll tell you later..."

Here we go again. It means that we will have not only "now", but also some "later". Is it really a new pickup method? Or is he not only an empath, but also like from this, Philip Dick book, precog? Who knows the future? I wanted to make a joke on this topic, but I didn't. And I immediately understood why.

I wanted this "later" to happen, and I was afraid to scare it off. I liked Frank.

"Do you really see the life of Caracalla?"

He nodded.

"But not quite clear. As if through a fogged glass. I do not know what color his horse was. What his family home in Syria looked like. Where exactly he lived in Britain. But I see the human process that took place in these indistinct shores..."

"I already want to listen," I said and unexpectedly made eyes at him.

Well, not like "Eyes-Eyes" with a capital letter, but quite bug-eyed. Frank noticed and smiled. Moreover, he smiled nicely, not like a hunter, confident that the bird was already in his net, but as if he understood that these were completely accidental eyes that did not give anyone any permissions, and it was funny to him with me that they suddenly happened to me, and he even a little awkward after accidentally noticing them.

"I think," he said, "there will be time for that."

And then I felt that I'm turning wet a little.

After all, the body lived its ancient wise life, and has already taken over the leadership of the process. And who am I to interfere in the struggle of a biological species for survival? I always ask myself this question in such circumstances, and I answer that I'm no one.

Andreas gradually began to show signs of life. He got up on all fours, got to the music center and changed the program. Smooth ambient electronics started playing, which you almost immediately stop noticing and hearing.

"How are you?" Frank asked.

"I've missed you a lot," Andreas replied, "You look from there like two..."

"Emoji?" I asked.

"No. Incarnations."

That's how I heard – "incarnations", and asked again:

"Why incarnations?"

"Car-na-tions," Andreas repeated clearly, "Two carnations, red and white ones. Waiting for bees..."

And he giggled.

At first I thought Andreas might have picked up some, as Frank put it, empathic waves from his psychedelic depths, but then I realized that he probably just heard our conversation.

There was a knock on the door.

"They call us to eat," Andreas said, "Go, the food is good here."

"And you?" Frank asked.

Andreas just waved his hand.

The dining hall looked impressive. It was a room with a round transparent wall, half-screened from the evening sun. The table was also round, and quite large, enough, perhaps, for the entire staff of King Arthur.

At the table sat So, Michael, Rajiv and both girls, Sarah and May. In addition to them, a new character has appeared, as I understood it, So's husband.

It was an elderly, gray-bearded man in a denim (I'm not kidding) tuxedo. That is, his bourgeois smoking jacket with black lapels gleaming in the light was sewn from worn to whiteness black denim  with serious torn holes on the sleeves and chest. Apparently, another desology sample. They repainted the yacht, and now they are testing another product on a daddy.

"Sasha," I introduced myself.

"Timofey," the man in the tuxedo replied. "So says that my name should be in Russian: Tim-or-Fay, if you spell it. Really just Tim. Sit down, my friends."

I was hungry, and there was no need to persuade me. Moreover, the table looked very appetizing.

There were raw fish cuts, salads in coconut shells, tiny jars of oatmeal on yogurt, all sorts of pancakes, plates with cheese and a whole lot of greens. There was a steward standing next to the table, an elderly and absolutely not sexy Japanese in a sailor suit (that's right, otherwise for some reason only young sexy Japanese girls are dressed in it). The sailor suit, however, turned out to be not quite real, it's collar was simply printed on the fabric. The steward was holding a menu in his hands.

"If you want eggs or steak, you can order," Tim said.
I noticed that he himself was eating French fries with fried fish.

"Thank you," I replied, "There's quite enough here."

We ate in silence for about five minutes. The sashimi was delicious, the salads were the freshest, and I even ate some cheese, which I never do after fish. It's fine, I'll eat more salad and the God will forgive me.

"Can I have tea?" I asked the Japanese.

There were a lot of different types of tea on the menu. I settled on a modest bergamot, and in a few minutes a white porcelain teapot was brought to me. No, they definitely knew how to live here.

"Sasha," Tim said, "you're Russian, aren't you?"

I nodded.

"I have one question for you. Tell me, why are you interfering in our elections? Why did you put this red-haired monster in the White House?"

They laughed at the table. So looked reproachfully at her husband.

"Is it really not clear?" I replied.

"No. That's why I'm asking."

"It's just that, you see," I said, giving my voice that shade of sincere girlish healthfulness that so excites older men, "we hate your freedom."

The table laughed again.

"But why?" Tim asked.

"Well, as why. We understand that we will never be as free and beautiful as you are, and all we can do is gnash our teeth in a dark corner and try to shit on you out of envy."

Now not only the young people laughed, but also Tim himself.

"Good answer," he said. "You're funny. But if you print this in an American newspaper, ninety percent of people will think you're being serious."

"No one will take seriously what they say in the newspaper nowadays," Sarah said.

"My daughter Sarah, like all wealthy young people, is very left-wing and very radical. She doesn't understand that you can simultaneously disbelieve the newspapers and obediently swallow all their slops."

"Is Sarah your daughter?" I asked in surprise, "So she's Michael's sister?"

"Yes," Sarah said, "what's so special about that?"

"I thought you were his girlfriend. You argued with him like that..."

This time I amused everyone, including even the Japanese steward.

"Well," Tim said, "that's right, they really argue and fight all the time, since childhood. But Michael is gay. Rajiv is his boyfriend."

I looked at Michael, then at Rajiv, and then for some reason at So. She smiled, a little guiltily, it seemed to me.

"How do you feel about gays?" Tim asked.

 "Me? Good."
 
"But So can not accept this to the end [TODO:synonym] in the depths of his soul," Tim said, "No, she's extremely delicate, she won't say a single word, and she never has. But she always meets beautiful young girls and brings them home. The girls think they have finally found a rich lesbian, and So hopes that Michael will finally become interested with a normal women's pussy..."

I laughed, but also blushed at the same time. So made round eyes and shook her head."

"Sasha, don't believe him. And you, Tim, stop shocking our guest. Michael had nothing to do with it, we talked about architecture and history. Sasha is very smart, and is now making her magical journey around the world. And she doesn't need your money at all, so you have no reason to be rude."

"I think," I said, "that was a compliment. If I was deemed worthy of seducing such an advanced boy. Especially if he's gay."

Michael gave me a sort of pocket curtsy from a sitting position.

Well, well. Sarah is not Michael's girlfriend, but his sister. How it's possible to make such a mistake... However, I just noticed that there is an emotional connection between them, and what kind of nature is it… It is not difficult to make a mistake here.

I looked at Rajiv with new eyes.

At first I thought there was something threatening about him, but now I made a clarification for myself: he looked not so much like a villain, but like an actor playing medieval villains in Bollywood. He also laughed in a special way, sardonically and ominously, as if he guessed a special dark meaning in the words that amused everyone, and only he could see it. Still, it was hard to imagine Michael and Rajiv together. But my contract didn't oblige me to do so.

Tim was deep in conversation with the girls, it seems they were discussing some kind of interior. I turned to Frank, who was eating his third or fourth coconut salad.

"I have an excursion to the hippodrome tomorrow. I need to get some sleep. I'll probably take off after eating."

"Me too," he said, and smiled.

"What d'you mean? Take a walk?

"No, I mean completely. It's time to move from the yacht. They just gave me a ride here."

"Where are you going now?"

"A couple of days in Istanbul," he replied, "And then to Harran."

"Where is it?"

"Right here. In Turkey."

"What," I asked, "is an interesting place?"

"For me, yes. Very much."

"What's there?"

"Nothing in modern days. But in antiquity there was one of the main temples of the Lunar cult."

"Yeah," I said, "I see. Is this a journey along the line of your empathic history?"

He nodded.

"And where will you live in Istanbul?" I asked.

"I don't know yet."

I hesitated for a second. Then I said:

"There are plenty of rooms available in my hotel. And she's right in the middle. Not much, the rooms are small, but quite a cozy place."

"It might be interesting," he replied.

For some reason we stopped looking at each other. Then he said:

"It's very interesting. It feees me from the need to look for something. Will you wait for me? I have to pack my things."

"I'll wait," I said, "I'm not in a hurry."

When everyone was already leaving the dining room, Andreas entered it with a guilty smile, only by this time ripe for eating. There was still a lot of food around. Imperial welding waited patiently. Life was wonderful.

Frank left to pack, and I returned with the rest of the fighters to the corporate anarchist HQ. They lit two joints at once. I didn't smoke with them, but after half an hour, reality still changed so much that I was scared of Frank returning to the cabin.

Really, it was not difficult.

No, it's not for nothing that we remembered Kylo Ren today. Frank managed to put on some dark robe with a hood, very similar to the outfit of the Sith from Star Wars. It was in perfect harmony with his bearded Roman face, but it didn't match at all with the worn camouflage bag.

Roman face. He really had a Roman face, I could swear to that now. But I wonder if such a thing would have seemed to me without his story?

"I'm ready," Frank said.

"Are you leaving already?" Michael asked.

He didn't even look at me. Apparently, Mom's plan didn't succeed, but I wasn't too upset.

"Can I say goodbye to So?"

"She's having a massage right now," Sarah smiled, "It'll be over in an hour."

"Then I'll call," I said. "She has my email, and I have her business card. Thanks for the dinner."
