# Chapter 13

In one of our meetings, the Moon, who came to me in the form of a girl, asked an unexpected question.

"Your father wants to see you as the new Alexander. But do you know how Alexander became Alexander?"

"What does it mean -- how?" I didn't understand. "He was born Alexander and was never anything else."

"Wrong. He was born just a little naked human. He got the name later. But at what point did he become the Alexander we know? When exactly did he become a god on earth?"

This question made me think.

Indeed, there was something that distinguished Alexander from the rest of the great generals. His soldiers knew that they were being led into battle by a living god, and therefore were not afraid of anything. But when did Alexander become so famous?

The moon, of course, read my thoughts.

"It's not about his fame," she said. "But in that special quality, which his friends explained either by the fact that he was a disciple of Aristotle, or by the fact that he was the son of Zeus. There was something divine about Alexander, everyone felt it. But when did it first appear in him?"

It was difficult for me to answer, although I knew Alexander's story.

"Remember the Battle of Chaeronea," said the Moon.

Of course I remembered it. Alexander's very first battle, in which he participated with his father at the age of eighteen. Alexander and his horsemen defeated the Sacred Band of Thebes, previously considered invincible. Actually, the detachment remained undefeated -- all three hundred Hoplites died in battle.

I have always been amazed by the history of this squad. Three hundred soldiers-lovers, divided into pairs of "lover-beloved" -- the most menacing striking force of the Greek army, which many times beat even the outnumbered Spartans. It was said that the invincibility of the Sacred Band was explained by the fear of the fighters to cover themselves with shame in front of their loved ones, and by the fact that the lovers fought side by side, protecting each other.

It was also said that the Theban Band was called Sacred because its soldiers participated in a special mystery at the grave of Jocastus, the charioteer of Hercules -- and in them, in all at once, the god Eros was possessed, who was becoming horrifying when his love frenzy turning into a fighting rage.

The goddess nodded as if listening to my thoughts. Then she said softly:

"This Band could not be defeated, as it is impossible to defeat God -- but it was possible to slaughter all its fighters, which Alexander did. And then God had no choice but to honor the winner with his attention and make him his new chosen one and his vessel. After the Battle of Chaeronea, the Sacred Band of Thebes did not go into oblivion, as historians claim. It was only reduced to one person, and that person was Alexander himself."

"I think that's an exaggeration," I said.

"Not at all. You know how the Sacred Band fought, right?"

One could be offended by such a question -- any military officer with a rank higher than a centurion knows this. Even if he prefers women. 

"They were crashing into the center of the enemy's order," I replied, "and, regardless of losses, cut a path to the commanders, killing them on the spot, both foremen and generals… Having lost control, the enemy army scattered."

"And now remember what Alexander did during his main battle with Darius."

"At the Gavgamels? First he led his cavalry to the right along the Persian flank. The Persians thought that he was bypassing the thorns, and moved aside with him. And then, when the enemy order stretched out and the Persian rear was exposed, Alexander turned sharply and rode with his friends into the gap that had formed -- right at Darius… He fled, and the almost victorious Persian army turned out to be beheaded... indeed... both then and at Issa, Alexander fought his way straight to Darius and his guards. Of course! This is a Sacred Band's tactic!

I woke up and spent the whole morning thinking about the goddess's story.

A strange, exciting explanation... seeming very much like the truth. The sacred band of Thebes... love and death are always side by side, especially if it's true love.

However, as much as I admired the antiquity, I was not going to introduce such units in the Roman army. Nowadays, men no longer love, but simply fornicate with each other and are not afraid of shame. They would rather run away from the battlefield into the bushes together than will be fighting back to back.

By the way, about Alexander -- they say that it was for the decimation of the Sacred Band the Greeks took revenge on him all his life. Him and his father too. This was the main reason why he first burned Thebes, selling all the inhabitants into slavery, and then left for the East forever.

But even there he was overtaken by the poison of Aristotle. His father, King Phillip, was killed by a Greek bodyguard who avenged Chaeronea, with a single dagger swing. The rulers should choose guards more wisely…
