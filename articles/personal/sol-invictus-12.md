# Chapter 12

Frank and I flew not to Harran itself, there was no airport there, but to Urfa next to it. We left very early, and I slept through the entire flight, and woke up just before landing.

Green rocky plain and distant mountains. Nothing interesting in the window. The airport of Urfa, or Sanliurfa, was like thousands of provincial airports: parallelepipeds of concrete and glass.

"Welcome to Edessa," Frank said.

"Where to?"

"Edessa," he repeated. "That's what this city was called in ancient times."

He managed to change into a purple cape with a hood right on the plane while I was napping. In Istanbul, they did not pay attention to him, but it made quite an impression on the locals. People looked back at him and smiled. Especially girls. He must have reminded them of the Turkish Santa Claus in his youth. Or Claus-Pasha? We need to ask some Turk who they have on New Year's Eve rides around Cappadocia on reindeers.

After receiving our luggage, we got into a taxi and drove to our hotel without incident.

"Asymmetrical and menacing," Frank said, looking around the angular yellow building.

"Is the Emperor satisfied?"

"The Emperor is indifferent to luxury."

But I could see that he was pleased.

The hotel "El-Ruha", which I chose myself, perfectly fit into both the aesthetics and the ideology of our trip: it looked like a Roman fortress. Or even the first few floors of the Tower of Babel.

It wasn't bad inside either. Vaults and arches – such a Basilica Cistern with sofas placed between the columns.

At the reception there was a bust of Alexander the Great -- quite a high-quality marble copy, blackened in the recesses for solidity. Like, the patina of centuries. Frank asked permission to approach the bust to examine it from all sides.

Jealous of a colleague, I thought, and asked:

"Has Alexander checked in here too?"

"His veterans lived here," Frank said. "Once there was a settlement of retired warriors."

The ceiling in our room was also arched. Frank looked him over approvingly and said,

"There's an underground pool here."

It turns out that while I was checking in, he managed to study the hotel brochure. We wanted to cool off, and went downstairs.

The pool was arranged in a natural grotto with stone walls, if not for the electric lighting, it would have been possible to decide that we had fallen into a cave. After bathing, Frank chose a couch covered with a purple sheet (such a great match, I thought), stretched out on it and fell asleep. I took a nap on the next one, and then we were woken up by other guests, and went upstairs.

"I was dreaming," I said. "Something disturbing, but I don't remember exactly."

"It happens when you sleep underground."

We made love, this time without masks, and everything was wonderful. I called him "emperor" and "my lord" a couple of times, which gave him special pleasure -- it's unlikely that he often heard it from freedom-loving American women who are every second wondering if it's time to sue. Then we got dressed and went to dinner.

After dinner we went down to the underground pool again. This time the grotto was empty. I asked Frank to tell me something else about Caracalla. I thought he was going to talk about a trip to the Lunar temple in Carrhae, but I heard something completely different…
