# Chapter 3

When Verka and I (she was my traveling companion in India, and we didn't really communicate afterwards) went to Arunachala, it was a real trip. And not at all because of the substances.

At first, a dull agricultural zone dragged on for a long time. Gradually, such very peculiar rocky slides began to appear around, as if poured by someone from huge boulders (I realized at the sight of them, where fairy tales about giants come from) – and then the car stopped at the intersection, I turned my head and almost kissed a huge white buffalo with rattles on its horns. Moreover, the horns were painted in three colors.

A buffalo-drawn cart. It's like three thousand years ago. Only there were no rubber tires then… Although who really knows him.

And after that, I was high all the day – as if I had moved from reality to a fairy tale. My friend and I got to Arunachala and checked into a hotel for pilgrims. There were only rooms available on the ground floor; Verka fell asleep, and I went for a walk in the courtyard. And I saw him. This German.

That is, I later found out that he was German, and then it was just a gray-haired old man with long hair who was sitting on a small chair and carefully looking at a candle burning on the floor, a bowl in an aluminum shell, like those that are sold in "Ikea".

The windows and doors of the hotel faced the courtyard. When a door was opened in a room on the ground floor, it turned into a narrow alcove, visible through to everyone passing by.

This German with his candle looked so strange that I stopped at the door and stared at him like a sheep[TODO:translation].

After a couple of seconds, he felt that I was looking at him, raised his head, nodded – and made an inviting gesture: come in. And, most importantly, there was another chair next to the candle, as if he was sitting in front of an open door, waiting for my visit. There was something unreal about it. It was as if this buffalo from the crossroads took me with her soft lips and brought me right here... I went in, for some reason closed the door and sat down on a stool opposite.

"Look at the candle," he said in English.

I stared at the candle.

– Do you believe in significant meetings? - he asked. – Capable of turning your whole life around?

–Yes,– I said. – But it's better when it happens without the police.
He smiled.

– You came to Arunachala because you are looking for the truth.

"Well, yes" I agreed. "In a some way" 

"I'll tell you about the truth", – he said, – "listen carefully and look at the candle".

And that's when I heard about the signs and shovels. However, then he added something else.

"The problem isn't that the truth can't be found, my girl. The problem is that there is too much of it on the market. It's too easy to find it. Life is short, and there are too many stalls selling this product... You won't even have time to get around them all, what kind of product to taste there. Do you understand?

"So what to do?" I asked.

"First you need to understand that the truth cannot be learned from people".

"Why?"

"Because "Human" and "Truth" are antonyms"

"What do you mean?"

Every person is by nature a question. A blatant question. Where would he get an answer from? People can hide their questionability under various robes, cassocks, and so on, and distribute the great final teachings to others. But it's just business.
 
What's not business?

"The God" he smiled. "If it's a business, it's not with us. The truth can only be learned from God"

"And how? Is he talking to you?"

"He does. With me, and with you. With everyone."

"And when was the last time you talked to him?"

"We're talking to him right now" he said, "you and me"

Then I thought that he might be an ordinary madman. Or rather, a deeply religious person.

"And what does he tell you?"

What he says to me doesn't matter at all," he replied. – And it's even not your concern at all. It matters what he tells you.

"I don't hear anything" I said.

"You just think so. God does not speak in words. He encrypts his messages. But it is not difficult to decipher them"

"Do you know how?"

He nodded.

"Do you want me to become a Ramana for you for a while? I will explain as he would have done if he had lived in our time"

It was already interesting.

"Okay", I said. "Let's try"

"Look here. We sit here and look at the candle. At the same time, a stream of consciousness passes through your mind, sorry for this wild phrasing. Of course, this is not a stream, because consciousness is not a liquid – but that's what they say. Do you mind if I use that expression?"

"Who am I to argue with Ramana?"

He laughed.

"What is this stream? Look for yourself. You think something quickly, then you hear something, remember and so on. You feel a draft. Or you notice the smell of a burning wick. All this is mixed into a special combination of the alternately conscious, existing only in you. A unique stream of experiences and impressions, changing every moment. Do you understand?"

"I understand", I replied, "of course"

"This stream" he said, "is you. But it's also God. A mixture made from the divine soul mixed with matter"

"Is matter also God?"
