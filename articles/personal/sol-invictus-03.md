# Chapter 3
--

When Verka and I (she was my traveling companion in India, but we didn't really communicate after that) went to Arunachala, it was a real trip. And not at all because of the substances.

At first, a dull agricultural zone stretched on for a long time. Gradually, very peculiar rocky slides began to appear around, as if huge boulders were poured by someone (looking at them, I realized, where fairy tales about giants came from) -- and then the car stopped at the intersection, I turned my head and almost kissed a huge white buffalo with rattles on its horns. Moreover, her horns were painted in three colors.

A buffalo-drawn cart. It's like three thousand years ago. Only there were no rubber tires then… Although, who really knows.

And after that, I felt high all day -- as if I had moved from reality to a fairy tale. My friend and I got to Arunachala and checked into a hotel for pilgrims. There were only rooms available on the ground floor; Verka fell asleep, and I went for a walk in the courtyard. And I saw him. This German.

That is, I later found out that he was German, and then it was just a gray-haired old man with long hair who was sitting on a small chair and carefully looking at a candle burning on the floor, a bowl in an aluminum shell, like those that are sold in "Ikea".

The windows and doors of the hotel faced the courtyard. When a door was opened in a room on the ground floor, it turned into a narrow alcove, visible to everyone passing by.

This German with his candle looked so strange that I stopped at the door and stared at him like a sheep[TODO:slang].

After a couple of seconds, he felt that I was looking at him, raised his head, nodded, and made an inviting gesture: come in. And, most importantly, there was another chair next to the candle, as if he was sitting in front of an open door, waiting for my visit. There was something unreal about it. It was as if this buffalo from the crossroads took me with her soft lips and brought me right here... I went in, for some reason closed the door, and sat down on a stool opposite.

"Look at the candle," he said in English.

I stared at the candle.

"Do you believe in significant meetings?" he asked. "Capable of turning your whole life around?"

"I do," I said. "But it's better when it goes without the police."

He smiled.

"You came to Arunachala because you are looking for the truth."

"Well, yes" I agreed. "In some way" 

"I'll tell you about the truth", he said, "listen carefully and look at the candle"

And that's when I heard about the signs and shovels. However, then he added something else.

"The problem isn't that the truth can't be found, my girl. The problem is that there is too much of it on the market. It's too easy to find it. Life is short, and there are too many stalls selling this product... You won't even have time to get around them all, what kind of product to taste there. Do you understand?

"So what to do?" I asked.

"First you need to understand that the truth cannot be learned from people"

"Why?"

"Because "Human" and "Truth" are antonyms"

"What do you mean?"

Every person is a question by his nature. A blatant question. Where would he get an answer from? People can hide their questionability under various robes, cassocks, and so on, and distribute the great final teachings to others. But it's just business.
 
"What's not business?"

"The God" he smiled. "If it's a business, it's not with us. The truth can only be learned from God."

"And how? Is he talking to you?"

"He does. With me, and with you. With everyone."

"And when was the last time you talked to him?"

"We're talking to him right now," he said, "you and me."

Then I thought that he might be an ordinary madman. Or rather say, a deeply religious person.

"And what does he tell you?"

What he says to me doesn't matter at all," he replied, "and it's even not your concern. It matters what he tells you."

"I don't hear anything," I said.

"You just think so. God does not speak in words. He encrypts his messages. But it is not difficult to decipher them"

"Do you know how?"

He nodded.

"Do you want me to become a Ramana for you for a while? I will explain as he would have done if he had lived in our time"

It was already interesting.

"Okay", I said. "Let's try"

"Look here. We sit here and look at the candle. At the same time, a stream of consciousness passes through your mind, sorry for this wild phrasing. Of course, this is not a stream, because consciousness is not a liquid -- but that's what they used to say. Do you mind if I use that expression?"

"Who am I to argue with Ramana?"

He laughed.

"What is this stream? Look for yourself. You think something quickly, then you hear something, remember and so on. You feel a draft. Or you notice the smell of a burning wick. All this is mixed into a special combination of the alternately conscious, existing only in you. A unique stream of experiences and impressions, changing every moment. Do you understand?"

"I understand," I replied, "of course."

"This stream," he said, "is you. But it's also God. A mixture made from the divine soul mixed with the matter."

"Is matter also God?"

"Something like his nails or hair, let's say. Your nails are you?"

I shrugged.

"That's the same thing here. God, like the water, can be in different states. He may know that he is God. It's steam. He may not know that he is a god. It's the ice. And it can also be what we conventionally called a flow, a liquid. Something that sometimes understands its nature, sometimes not. Like a mixture."

"Perhaps."

God in his omniscient aspect is present everywhere and penetrates everything. A single nervous system passes through different states and forms, nowadays we would say -- an information network, which you can use even when you do not understand your nature at all and consists of only ice, like a snowman. You can ask God questions and get answers from him."

"How?"

"He will send you signs. A kind of personal ciphertext."

"I don't really understand," I said. "How will I decipher them?"

"You don't have to decipher anything. Messages are encrypted only for others. The instant configuration of your consciousness is unique and changes every second. Two entities know about it -- you and God. And at some point, a quiet voice arrives from the outside world: "Here! That's it!" Like an arrow pointing at something. This is the message: pay the attention to whatever you see, hear or think right now. There is no point in explaining in more detail. It is necessary to understand by experience."

I nodded. Then, without much interest, I thought: "Maybe it's true?"

And then the candlelight swayed a little. Lightly, as happens from a draft. I looked up at the German. He was smiling.

"Remember," he said, "God will only talk to you. Others will not see the signs sent to you. And you won't see what he tells others. Do you know what I mean?"

"Yes," I replied, "I understand. But what if I don't believe in God? I really really don't believe in him?"

"You believe in him. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to Arunachala."

"I know better what I believe in."

"Okay," he said, "what do you believe in?"

"I believe..." I hesitated, "I believe that we live in virtual reality. And I also believe in the unified animate nature of everything that exists. Just don't ask me how one will connect with the other."

"It's easy to connect," he replied, "Through God. Have you seen such photo sticks from tourists? A phone or camera is attached to them, and people take pictures of themselves."

"Yes," I said. "Selfie tripods."

"We all work for God these selfie tripods. God entrusts you to see your part of reality for him. How to work on a specially allocated garden bed."

I was already getting tired of such frequent repetition of the word "God". How much is possible?[TODO:translate]

"But why do you call it God?"  I asked.

He spread his hands.

"This word is popular among Indian saints. You can say whatever you want -- "spirit", "unified information network", "quantum conscious factor" and whatever else. All these are just inscriptions on the plates under which there are shovels. No matter how much you swarm, you won't find anything except other tablets. It's not about what we call it. It's about how we will use it."

"And how can this be used?"

"It depends on you," he replied. "Or rather, from God in you. You can't do anything yourself. God in you can do anything."

At that moment, the light swung again, and the door opened. Verka was standing on the threshold.

"You're here," she said and nodded to the German. "I've been looking for you everywhere, Sasha. You could have warned me at least..."

The next day, the three of us climbed Arunachala.

At first, Verka didn't want to go. The sky was low and gray, and we were afraid of rain. But Hans-Friedrich assured us that there would be no rain until the evening and it was possible to do without a local guide, since he knew the way himself.

On the way, Hans-Friedrich told about himself. He was a microbiologist, then became a businessman, but now he already quit and was traveling. "Retired", Verka thoughtfully translated for herself. He considered himself a follower of Ramana Maharshi and was coming to Arunachala every year. Also, he attended Goenka's Vipassana retreats, where he strongly advised us to go. He assured me that one does not interfere with the other in any way.

"Climbing Arunachala is a very special experience," he said. "Look carefully around and try to hear what this place wants to tell you… It will whisper something important to you if you tune in yourself to its waves."

We went up -- Hans-Friedrich was leading the way, and we were behind.

Generally speaking, the place was not particularly impressive at first. Not that it's just such a Mountain from a capital letter -- just a green slope with boulders. But it was beautiful.

On the way, Hans-Friedrich sarcastically and ridiculously mocked the Indian gurus selling "enlightenment". According to him, the word "enlightenment" had two meanings: "futures" and "role-playing game". Verka asked how to understand this.

"Market participants are divided into enlightened and those seeking enlightenment," Hans-Friedrich replied. "These words, of course, should be taken in quotation marks. If you are "enlightened", then "enlightenment" is futures that you sell to other market participants. At the same time, this is your role-playing game. If you are a "seeker of enlightenment", then this is also your role-playing game, because after a year of working with previously purchased futures, you can portray enlightenment as well as any guru -- but your role does not allow this. Each of these role positions has its own language and its own function… However, do not clog your head, girls. Better look around. Where else will you see such beauty…"

The views really became more and more interesting.

Mountains rose around us in several colors – darker nearby, and lighter further, from brown to light blue on the horizon. I remember two or three mountains at once seemed to me like a woman's boobs, with a sharp peak, strongly shifted to the right edge.

Then I noticed something like a small burrow just a few centimeters wide in the earthen wall -- bright white mushrooms of a very delicate kind were growing inside. It's like such an apartment for dwarfs. Their housing looked flimsy and unreliable, as if it could collapse at any second, and I experienced all the proper associations with human life.

A couple of minutes later I came across a beautiful green scarab beetle with long, long legs. Noticing that I was looking at him, he began sluggishly getting out of my field of attention, and I left him alone.

Then we met a pair of light gray monkeys - one looked like a monkey and stood on all four paws. And the other, apparently a male, was eating a banana. This male had a real men's sports hairstyle, such as a barber's hedgehog, and his face looked like a gloomy, conscious and understanding proletarian of the revolutionary years. "Monkey heart," Bulgakov would say if he was a Hindu.

If the world was trying to convey some mysterious message to me with the help of all these signs (I, of course, remembered the conversation with Hans-Friedrich), it flew past and fell into a thicket of burdocks.

Then I stopped thinking about yesterday and started just looking around.

The higher we climbed, the darker it became around -- the top of the mountain was covered with either fog or low clouds.

This ascending into the twilight had an inspiring effect on me -- I was filled with awe and began to imagine that I had entered the vaults of the temple.

Before we finally plunged into the fog, I really noticed a temple far below, even a whole complex -- a rectangular field surrounded by a gray wall with four tall pyramidal towers (they stood not in the corners, but in the middle of each of the walls). There were two smaller pyramids in the center of the field. It seemed to me that this building is not Indian, but some kind of Mexican. Such a Tenochtitlan.

Then only the narrow trail remained in the fog, and a few minutes later we reached the top of Arunachala.

It was a small rocky patch overgrown with sparse bushes. In one place, a powerful metal trident stuck out of the ground with its points upwards. The sign of Shiva.

After all, it was not the fog around, but low rain clouds which did not dare to become rain. Hans-Friedrich said that this happens here often.

I stepped away from everyone, and stood not far from the trident, on the very cliff, and stared down. I could see nothing. Rather, I saw only clouds of some vapor, flying toward our mountain. They were flying below us and above us, from all sides. It's like in an airplane passing clouds when climbing, only not so fast.

The cloud vapor was surprisingly fresh and even, I would say, fragrant -- it seemed to me that it slightly smelled of this red gum, masala with betel, the smell of which constantly overtakes any Indian street. Only the shade of the fragrance was thinner and fresher and did not irritate, but, on the contrary, hinted at some absolutely divine freedom and joy.

"The level of Shiva," I whispered a phrase that I didn't completely understand myself, "the level of Shiva..."

Now I remember that moment and realize that I was absolutely, unconditionally happy at that moment. But then, of course, I didn't understand it.

Or rather, I understood it, but incorrectly. It seemed to me that the blissful fog is hinting at something waiting for me ahead, as if it promised happiness... but that was exactly it.

Today, from the height of my thirties, I would probably say that happiness is the second when you believe in the possibility and feasibility of your happiness, such a bizarre recursive loop in our brain jukebox. And there is probably nothing else possible in the mirrors among those we wander through our lives.

After all, it was amazing and lasted for a long time, half an hour or more. I was standing over the cliff, looking into the warm cloudy fog, and soon it began to seem to me that it was not gray, but a soft purple, and it was Shiva himself rushing at me now, touching me, playing with me, and promising me something... I could almost see the golden figure of the god dancing in the clouds… Oh, how much he was promising... I even got jealous at some point - was he promising this to everyone, or only to me?

"I want to meet you, dancing god," I thought with inspiration and joy, "I want to get as close to you as possible. Appear in front of me in whatever shape you want... Show me what you can do... Please, please..."

Probably, I shouldn't have asked for this -- the endless miracle almost immediately ended. A second later, Hans-Friedrich touched my shoulder. I told in a nutshell about what was happening to me.

"What was that?" I asked.

"A gift," he replied. "Everything that happens on Arunachala is a gift from God."

I looked back. Verka was standing about ten meters away from us and didn't listen to what we were talking about.

"I didn't receive any signs," I said, "No instructions. I just felt good. As good as I can't remember whether I was ever feeling like this..."

"There can't be a better sign," smiled Hans-Friedrich. "You came to visit God, and it was good for you to visit him."

"Well, if you interpret it that way..."

"There is no need to interpret anything," he said, "Just watch what's happening to you. God speaks softly, but very clearly. You came to visit him and had a nice time. I would've been pleased.

"Me too," I nodded. "I was…"

It sounded unexpectedly sad. I suddenly wanted to stand on the cliff again and expose my face to the purple fog, and meet Shiva again (I had already fantasized a lot about my experience), but it was clear that this wave of unbearable happiness could not be returned and not forged. The miracle was over.

"It's time for us to go down," Hans-Friedrich said, "It may start to rain. But I want to tell you one thing before we leave the top, because this is a special place and every word spoken here weighs a lot… What I told you yesterday about signs and directions is the way. A special way under the personal guidance of God."

I wanted to repeat that I don't believe in God, but then I remembered how I had just communicated with Shiva and smiled. Hans-Friedrich noticed this smile.

"All right," he said. "Call it whatever you want. Call it the mystery of the world. Or the heart of everything. You said Shiva looked at you. Do you want to know where from he was looking at you?"

I shrugged my shoulders. Then nodded.

"You can do it. You can walk there."

"How?"  I asked.

"Trust the signs. Learn to see them, be always on the alert – and don't miss your chance. You will definitely have it. The signs will show you everything you need. This is a journey that relies on itself and does not require anything else."

"Thanks," I said, "And why are you actually telling me all this?"

"I don't have much longer to live," Hans-Friedrich replied. "I just want someone to get the magic secret that I've been using all my life as a gift. And you seem like a great candidate to me."

"Why?"

"For exactly the same reason. No one could have entered my room yesterday. Your friend could have come in. But it was you who came..."

"I see," I said. "Is it a kind of initiation?"

"He smiled, and touched his forehead with his index finger, and then mine."

"Now it happened. The secret officially passes to you. You know everything you need for the ultimate journey. Consider it a gift from Shiva."

"Well," I said, "when should I start the journey? At what point?"

"You'll find out. I promise, you'll find it out for yourself. For now, just put it all in your mind. Write it down in a deep corner of your memory and forget it for a while. Don't tell anyone about this and don't take traveling companions. You can't go there with a friend. The ultimate journey is a personal journey."

The way back to the guesthouse turned out to be a little scary, and for a while overshadowed all other impressions for me. We were running away from the approaching rain, and Hans-Friedrich led us along through the road -- we did not walk at all, but jumped over bumps and stones, zigzagging down the hill. Several times I thought that I would definitely break my neck during these jumps. Then I decided that we got lost and would not get out of these thickets. Both times I managed to get very angry with Hans-Friedrich, and I was even embarrassed by the profane feelings on the sacred mountain. But everything turned out well.

Interestingly, the rain that we were rushing away from never showered. But in the evening I left my sandals outside, and at night rainstorm broke out, so they were soaked to the point of complete unusability.

In the morning, Hans-Friedrich discreetly said goodbye to us and left. I didn't ask for his phone or email.

Verka and I walked around the ashram for a couple more days, bought some incense and music cassettes with bhajans (these are such religious hymns), stayed in meaningful silence for several hours in an empty room with a large portrait of Ramana, and left too.
