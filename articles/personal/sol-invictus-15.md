# Chapter 15

When, having somehow survived Frank's identification and subsequent interrogation, I returned from the police station to our (now mine) room at *El-Ruha*, everything was more or less clear.
The two on the moped were, as the police thought, bandits from Syria. They followed us from Urfa – apparently, Frank introduced himself to them as a resident of California. Looks like they weren't as idiots as he thought they were. Maybe they were hunting Americans. Or maybe he blurted out something thoughtless that he didn't tell me about - after all, terrorists also have their own trigger topics.
They stabbed him to death in a deserted passage – and stayed only to leave ideological graffiti in Arabic on the wall. From which it became clear that they were ideological terrorists. Their moped has already been found. They themselves are not.
"They hit me from above and from behind," said the officer I was talking to. – That's it…
He got up from his chair, took a few stealthy steps around the room, rose on tiptoe, as if hovering over someone walking in front - and quickly and terribly stabbed him from above.
– Right above the collarbone. A skillful hand…
Now they were looking for them. But there were a lot of similar types around. Syria is very close.
I gave Frank's belongings and documents to the police and left my coordinates in case his parents, who already knew about the accident and were supposed to come to Turkey soon, wanted to talk to me.
Even though I 'm back in Urfu and Harran were left far behind, I could not come to my senses in any way. The shock was so strong that I didn't even think about Frank. In all this, it was as if there was some kind of mockery of fate that was not understood in time.
The Emperor goes to the temple of the Moon… The Emperor goes to the temple of the Moon… At first I assumed that I had seen a film on this topic. These are shot in batches in Asia every year, and every year they are getting dumber, and the special effects are getting more colorful. But I didn't find the movie on the Internet. Then I started reading about Caracalla.
A brief account of his life almost completely coincided with what Frank told me – except for the story about the love of the Moon. There was not a word about it anywhere. Paragraph by paragraph, I was moving towards the end of the imperial life–and I felt that I was about to learn something terrible.
Of course, that's what happened.

*On April 8, 217, Caracalla and his retinue left Edessa for Carrhae to honor the local lunar deity. He himself rode on a white stallion, wrapped in a purple cape-caracalla, to which he owed his nickname. Lictors and centurions raced ahead, dispersing oncoming people, behind – senators and horsemen close to the emperor, the so-called amici (as if "friends" of Alexander, whom Caracalla imitated), even further – Scythians-bodyguards in red cloaks. At some point, the emperor made a sign to stop – he needed to relieve himself. He walked away from the road and sat down in the bushes. The escorts moved aside out of delicacy. Then Centurion Julius Marciallis, who was the emperor's messenger, went to him as if on some urgent business. Approaching the squatting Caracalla, he suddenly stabbed him with a dagger from above – so that the blade passed over the collarbone. The Emperor died instantly…*

Frank repeated Caracalla's last trip.
He left Edessa and almost reached the temple of the Moon in Carrhae. I was his entourage. Moreover, I worked as his lunar deity for a whole week–but I didn't even know if the possibility of such a turn of events had occurred to him.
It was an exciting game for him, but his life was at stake in the end… Harran's ancient power was not to be trifled with.
"Probably," someone's quiet voice was saying inside me, "it's better not to turn over old stones, so as not to wake up the scorpions sleeping under them. It is better not to whistle forgotten melodies, so as not to cause gloomy spirits. There are dreams from which it is better to wake up right away..."
Frank's belongings were taken away by the police. But when I reached into my bag, the first thing I came across was a plastic bag with views of Istanbul. It was lying on top of the rest of my things. By the shape of the package, I guessed what was in it, and my chest jumped.
They were masks. Both are Moons and Suns, arranged with soft packaging plastic with air bubbles.
Moreover, there were three other items in the same package that Frank had never shown me – handcuffs, a handcuffs, a huge silver-colored dildo and a BDSM collar with spikes.
There was also a note:
Sasha,
You're a great moon goddess, thank you. If something happens to me in Harran, don't tell the cops about these masks. Give them back to Tim and Co. Please do as I ask.
Your Caracalla
 
PS don't throw away sex toys. As long as they are in the same package with masks, there will be no questions on the screening. A set for role-playing games. Proven by experience. Sex toys are legal in Turkey, but antiquities are not. But don't be afraid, they won't understand that these are antiquities. Just in case, put everything in your luggage.
 
I wanted to wake up from the nightmare faster, but it turned out that it was not so easy. The nightmare didn't want to go anywhere. On the contrary, he acquired more and more ugly details.
What does it mean – antiquities are forbidden? I went online. Truth. It was dangerous to transport antique art objects across Turkey.
My first impulse was to call the police and give them the masks. I took out the phone card given to me at the police station, picked up the receiver from the lever – but something stopped me.
"Please do as I ask."
It was the last request of a man with whom I had been making love for many days. I even thought a couple of times that I loved him, although most likely I was intoxicated by the strangeness of what was happening. But anyway, he died, and the only thing I could do for him was to fulfill his request.
I hesitated for a while.
I didn't want to complicate my relationship with the Turkish police. Or rather, I didn't want to have them at all. According to the law, it would probably be necessary to give these masks to them. Perhaps they were stolen from somewhere and they were searched for. If these are really valuable antique artifacts, I could seriously go to jail for them for the rest of my still quite young life.
On the other hand, I had Frank's note with his request. At least some kind, but a document. It could have shortened my sentence by about half…
I was lost in thought. Hell, Frank was able to strain even from the other world.
In fact, I already knew what I would do, but to clear my conscience, I decided to wait for some sign.
It's so easy for the world and Lord Shiva to send me some clear unambiguous sign. For example, if a photo of St. Basil's Cathedral comes across on the Internet now, and there is a garbage can with two masks sticking out of it, I will quietly throw them away and go home to Moscow…
I went down to the hall, had a snack in the buffet (out of grief I drank a can of red Coca-Cola with sugar, which in today's cultural conditions is equivalent to a bottle of vodka from Dostoevsky) and went upstairs.
I had a new letter in my mail. From Co.
We exchanged addresses in an Istanbul taxi, but I didn't expect that she would actually write to me someday. She might not have written if it hadn't been for this tragedy.

Sasha!
I know about Frank. His parents thought he was still with us and called. They are, of course, terrified. Are you hurt? I can imagine what you've been through.
We are in Istanbul – and we will be here for some time. Fly in. We'll try to calm you down.
If you want, we won't talk about it at all.
We're waiting.
With love,
Co and Tim

I wonder if she knew about Frank's request for masks? And why does a person even think about these masks before death? Maybe they act on the psyche?
Anyway, I was waiting for a sign – and this, of course, is it. It's hard not to notice. But I already knew without any signs that I would do everything as Frank asked. Whatever it takes. I was just afraid I'd have to find So and Tim myself. But everything was extremely convenient.
When I checked in my luggage at the airport, I had a panic attack.
It seemed to me that the mustachioed guards of the order were mockingly and maliciously looking in my direction – and everything that was happening in the world was a single inhuman conspiracy directed against me.
Personal growth coaches teach that you cannot see reality in this light. But the fate of any living being, including a personal growth coach, proves that there is simply no other way. They will be separated into proteins (and in the case of cremation – into atoms), and the whole world will be in a share.
Sitting in the waiting room, I imagined in every detail what was going to happen.
Here are the mustachioed Janissaries and Mamelukes staring into their X-ray kinescope, and my bag floats up to them… There are grins on their faces, they look at each other, pull her off the conveyor belt and study the tag where the name and a name. Another poke at the keyboard, and my photo is on the monitor.
And here I am at the station. There are masks, handcuffs and dildos on the table. An insinuating voice with a Turkish accent says:
– Khanum, you probably already guessed why we delayed your luggage…
I shrug my shoulders.
– We have doubts about your dildo. It is disproportionately large ("for Turkey" – the proud answer of the Slavs trembles in me, but at the last moment I restrain myself). In addition, the penis is covered with silver paint with a high metal content, and our scanners cannot look inside…
Smiling haughtily, I ask:
– And what do you want?
An insinuating voice answers:
– Have you ever faced a situation when you are asked to turn on your laptop at the control?
I nod.
– You probably guess that the control service officer is not particularly interested in your Instagram photos. The purpose of this procedure is to prove that your laptop is really a laptop, and not a bomb disguised as it.
– And then what?
– Khanum, we would ask you to demonstrate to the police that your, uh... instrument is really what it seems from the outside. Please show it in action. At least for five to ten minutes.
"But there aren't any batteries or motors,– I babble.
"That's not what we mean.
– And what?
I am an outraged innocence myself. There are tears in my eyes, but you can't fool Mamelukes and Janissaries. They swell with formidable Turkish testosterone:
– Since you are so incomprehensible, Khanum, we will have to detain you indefinitely…
And so I am being taken to an underground prison where hundreds of indomitable Russian girls are languishing, removed from Turkish planes for carrying silver members…
Putin, of course, will have nothing to do with me. He won't interfere at all. Or maybe he will come along with his sidekick Erdogan to have fun – and the two of them will watch from behind a special mirror how another girl's will could not stand the interrogation with passion…
When the announcement of boarding the plane pulled me out of an imaginary Turkish prison, I was already quite comfortable there, resigned myself to everything and even began to make some useful acquaintances.
It seems to have worked out.
Although who knows, maybe in Istanbul luggage is also screened before delivery? To make sure that no one is carrying ancient treasures from the province?
I have always been interested in how a courier feels at the airport, hiding ten kilos of cocaine in his suitcase. I knew that now.
The plane to Istanbul was almost empty. We took off, I curled up at the window and finally relaxed. But at the very moment when the height dissolved my fears, someone sat in the next chair.
My shoogar has awakened again. It is unlikely that this is just a passenger who wants to change seats – there were many options in the cabin without neighbors at all. He wanted something from me.
– Can I talk to you?
Good English. Maybe he wants to glue me? All marriages are made in heaven, and that's where we are right now.
– About what?  I asked with an absent smile.
– About the masks you're carrying.
All right. We decided to take it on the plane.
Feeling how the Turkish prison is turning from an erotic fantasy into an objective and very close reality (and I thought I had already read everything about a suitcase of cocaine – it turns out not), I looked up at my neighbor.
Next to him sat an elderly, gray-haired Turk, so dark-skinned that he would have passed for his own even in Africa. But it was just a long–term sunburn - I have already learned to distinguish climatic hypersuggliness from racial.
He had a funny and touching corolla of disheveled white hair around a dark egg head and such a good–natured white mustache that my fear almost passed - although there was no rational reason for this. For some reason, I immediately felt trust and sympathy for him.
– What are you talking about?  I asked innocently.
Just don't be afraid," he said. – I'm not from the police. I am a private person. I've been following your friend Frank. Alas, a deceased friend. So in a way, I've been following you, too. Accidentally. Let me express my sympathy for your grief…
His face depicted all the proper emotions, and so diligently that my sympathy for him was finally strengthened. No, I guessed – my drama hardly burns through his heart (if only because it didn't burn through him even to me). But he, in any case, observed the proprieties very diligently. A Turkish gentleman. However, maybe there are such cops here?
– How long have you been following us?
– Since Istanbul.
– Why? The people who killed Frank were watching us, too.
He waved his hands.
"Oh, that's very, very different. No crime.
– It seems to me that spying on someone who doesn't know about it is already a crime.
"Frank knew," said the gentleman. – But I didn't mind. We were acquainted with him. We met and talked several times. He thought I was crazy. Harmless crazy… But I'm not crazy. I won't do you any harm. Let me introduce myself – Ahmet Gokcen, professor at Istanbul University. Faculty of letters.
Is this a faculty where they study some kind of letters? Letters? Or literature? But it was inconvenient to ask.
He handed me a brown card with a gold edge.
– There's a phone and mail. Be sure to keep it, this is my private card, not an official one. And you are Alexandra Orlova, I already know.
He called me "Alexandra", as in the passport. I always introduced myself as Sasha, which means he found out my name at the hotel or somewhere else. Through documents. Unless, of course, he really is not from the police.
I put the card in my pocket.
– Why were you following Frank? What's going on anyway? Do you know why he was killed?
– Oh, how to explain… You see, you can... how should I say... in general, this mystery has many levels. And I need to understand how deeply you've penetrated her. Only then will I know how to answer your question correctly so as not to create new problems.
"What secret?"
– The one connected with the masks of Caracalla. At the great mystery...
– Mysteries?
Gokcen made a serious face. Exaggeratedly serious–and I realized that he was really going to be serious.
– Tell me, have you ever heard the phrase "Sol Invictus" from Frank?
Yes... I remember the expression. But I'm not sure I understand him correctly. How does it translate?
– "The Invincible Sun". One of the names of the solar deity.
– Yes, exactly. I remember now.
– In fact, these words have another meaning, a secret and very ancient one. Is that what he was talking about?
– Definitely not about that.
–Good,– Gokcen said. – And about the Emperor Elagabalus?
– No.
- And about the "central projector"?
I was thinking.
– No, there was no such thing either.

"So," he said, "as I thought, you haven't penetrated the mystery deeply.
"I don't know what secret you're talking about," I replied, "but I've dived into the history of Caracalla to the full depth there is. And Frank could talk about different gods and goddesses for hours, too.
"You just scratched the surface. It's so deep... not just a mystery. It is, one might say, a mystery of secrets. She's like a black hole. A person does not understand what is hidden there. But if he passes close enough, a powerful attraction changes the route of his fate. That's what happened to Frank. The mystery seized him and threw him to his death.
"He repeated the story of Caracalla," I said.
"It's more likely the same thing happened to Caracalla," Gokcen whispered. – Exactly the same as with Frank.
But Caracalla didn't copy anyone.
– He didn't copy anyone – except maybe Alexander the Great. Caracalla was too close to the secret – and she crushed him. Frank and Caracalla, if you like, are brothers in misfortune. They had to die so that the situation could develop further. So that those who come next can join the game.
"Will they kill me too?"
– You? I don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. In this mystery, everyone has their own role. Its participants move in orbits. It all depends on what orbit you're in. It will be found out soon.
– Where?
- Where you're going.
"Do you know where I'm going?"
Gokcen nodded.
– You're going to give away the masks. Well, or you think you're going to give them away.
– To whom?
– The one who gave them to Frank.
– And what will happen to me next?
Gokcen made a super serious face again. By this point, I already understood why he was making this pained grimace – the rest of the time he looked so frivolous that any of his words were perceived as a joke.
– Here, Alexandra, there are two possible options. The first one is the easiest and safest for you. This mystery will let you go, so to speak, and you will go on about your business. The comet flew past the black hole, turned slightly and flew off into space to twist its tail…
He said "turn tail", which means "to run away", but at that moment I understood him verbatim and romantically. Baba, what can you do here.
– The second option is not so harmless anymore. You also become part of the mystery. You get your own personal orbit around the black hole. It can be very far away, like Frank's – or, on the contrary, very close, so that you will know everything -everything – and you will eventually fall into this hole. Both in the first and in the second case, it is difficult to predict what will happen to you.
"Am I going to die?"
–Not necessarily,– Gokcen replied. – Frank just got on the trajectory of Caracalla, which really leads to death. There are many different orbits around this mystery, a lot. Not everyone leads to death. But, to be honest, this also happens...
– Do you know who killed him and why?
"If I had known, I would have reported it to the police," he said. – I can only speculate.
– Who did it?
- I do not know who exactly. But I can guess why.
- why?
– There are forces… Let's just say there are people guarding the peace and security of this world. They know that the Emperor Caracalla was killed at one time to prevent the Moon from entering the temple. Perhaps this visit could have ended in something creepy…
– Why?
Caracalla came from a very difficult family. His mother Julia Domna was originally from Syria. From Emesa. Does that mean anything to you?
I shook my head negatively.
– Imagine, your family has been serving the Sun for centuries. And you decided to defect to the moon… Should you be surprised if they try to stop you?
– Do you think that's the case?
– I don't know. Just one of the assumptions. One thing is clear – Karkalla for some reason did not want to be allowed into the temple of the Moon. And it was so serious that the Roman emperor–just think, the Roman emperor! – they decided to kill. And two thousand years later, a man appeared who made contact with Caracalla, even in a certain sense became him himself. And this man is trying to get to the ruins of the temple of the Moon with an incomprehensible purpose. What do you think the guards should do?
– But Frank… He was only half fooling around.
– Maybe. But these people never fool around.
–You're scaring me," I said. "So they weren't terrorists?"
Gokcen shrugged his shoulders.
– I'm not saying anything. I'm just guessing.
– I don't want to take these masks anywhere anymore. I want to throw them away. Maybe I'll give them to you? Do you want to?
Gokcen smiled.
I would like, of course, to have two such excellent artifacts in my collection. But that's not possible.
- why?
– I don't want to take any chances. These masks are alive and bite hard. They find their own owner. And they guard it. So you don't have to worry about the police.
– I'm not the owner. I'm just a courier.
Something akin to pity flashed in Gokcen's eyes.
– Tell me, just be honest. Didn't you wear one of those masks?
- yes.
– Just measuring? Or... don't be embarrassed, I know what they do in these masks.
–Or,– I replied. – And many times.
Gokcen grunted.
– Well, then I'll be surprised if the masks let you go. You see, these are very powerful objects – they gain power over the one who wears them. This is especially true of the Sun mask.
– What kind of power?
– They begin to dictate to people their actions.
I suddenly felt really scared.
– Tell me, can these masks, for example, make one person write another a note asking them to deliver them somewhere?
They're capable of anything you can think of," Gokcen replied. "And a lot of things you wouldn't even imagine." But if you're under the power of the mask, you won't understand it. You will think that you are fulfilling your own wish.
– And what does it take to get under the power of the mask?
– Put it on. At least once, if we talk about the Sun mask. They have an excellent memory.
I thought about it.
– Is it dangerous to wear only a Sun mask?
– Is it more dangerous. The moon has rather an auxiliary function. But in general, these masks have the same power. It just manifests itself in different ways…
– Is one of them male, the other female?
- no. One is the Sun, the other is the Moon.
– Tell me, why do they have such power? Because of these stones?
Gokcen nodded.
– And what are the stones on them? It's not jewelry, but some kind of black… I do not know, basalt?
Gokcen smiled.
– It's too early to talk about it now. Or rather, it's already late.
- why?
He held up his hand, showing me his watch.
We're going down. I'm going to my place. When we get off the plane, don't come near. We don't need to be seen together. You have my card. If you feel that you are stuck in this story deeper, get in touch. I'll tell you a lot of interesting things. You won't hear that from your friends.
– Do you know them?
He shook his head vaguely.
– It's better not to tell them about our meeting yet.
– And if they ask?
– If they ask, tell them. That's it, I'm saying goodbye. Call.
He got up and left the salon without turning around. His stooped back was still visible to me when a pictograph with straps lit up above his head. We were flying over Istanbul.
I looked at the card left by Gokcen.
It was a rectangle of brown plastic with a gold edge.
Prof. Dr. Ahmet Gökcen
Only phone and e-mail on proton-mail. From talking with Antosha, I knew that this provider is very popular in chain stores of high, because it is another Swiss proxy of the American special services, created specifically for people who, because of the American special services, do not fully trust Google, and the CIA will never knock Russian trash on its own cocaine.
Let's see, Uncle, what are your bookmarks… I turned the card over.
There was no name or surname there either. Only the gold embossing is a statue of a lion holding a paw on a small globe. Nicely.
Maybe they're all just nuts? Both Frank and this Gokcen. And then I too – since I'm taking these fucking masks somewhere after all.
I don't know why, but I was afraid to keep this card. In a taxi, I took a picture of her on my phone – and tore the original into pieces and threw it out the window.
Hopefully it was biodegradable plastic.
