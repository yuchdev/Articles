# Chapter 14

Somewhere at this point, I began to fall asleep, and Frank's story smoothly flowed into a funny half-dream that I half saw and half invented myself in a nap -- a dispute between two generals on Russian propagandist TV. They sat in an empty studio and looked at each other disapprovingly.

"There is no homosexuality in our army and there has never been!" – one spoke sternly. "Such a pity," the other replied flirtatiously, "if there was, maybe in the 1941 they wouldn't have run across the whole country, but beat the enemy according to the orders, on his territory… And it would have been even without the 1941 disaster, because there would have been neither Tsushima, nor the revolution, nor Comrade Stalin..."

The generals looked appropriate to their political position, and I came to my senses from cultural shock.

Frank had gone somewhere, and for a while I lay alone by the pool in an underground cave, remembering his story.

Going up to an empty room, I made an online search for "The sacred band of Thebes", and found the trailer of the movie of the same name. However, clicking on it, I already guessed what I would see. Intricately groomed pumped-up queers from pornhub in textured leather belts, slightly resembling armor… I laughed for probably ten minutes.

Clearly, not over the fact that they are gay. I am for the rights of gays and especially lesbi, but I think that the real Sacred Band from Thebes looked differently. This is especially true of the style of sideburns and beards. And then, the ancient Greeks still had military art and black sails in the first place, and not recreational sex in black condoms, which do not show poop.

I've never heard of this squad, although I knew the Israeli band "Army of Lovers". Now the meaning of the name has become clear. Communication with Frank was not only pleasant, but also useful for the overall development.

The next morning, while I was still sleeping, Frank rented a car -- an old Camry. He respectfully said that he had never seen such an old Toyota before.

"She remembers Crassus," he said at breakfast. "It was in her trunk that the arrows were lying, which the Parthians brought down on the Roman legions at Carrhae..."

"Did you find the arrows there?" I asked in amazement.

"No. I found scratches from the tips. By the way, try to imagine it -- forty thousand people are standing in a square in the desert, such a formation will later be officially called a square in military science, and horsemen in colorful clothes are galloping around and shooting bows endlessly...

"I can," I replied, stirring my coffee with a spoon. "Such a *Borodino* of the poet Lermontov."

*The slain were stacked up in a mountain* <br>
*So wide it stopped the arrows...*

"Well, I don't think it stopped much," Frank said, "They most likely shot almost vertically so that the arrows would fall from above. What did the Romans do after that, do you think?"

I shrugged. 

"This is one of the first "never again" in human history. In the era of Caracalla, the Romans already had weapons against Parthian horses and camels -- metal barbs. They called them "tribulus", it's such a prickly plant. Their thorns greatly complicated the life of horses with camels and forced the Parthians to reconsider their tactics… Although they were still known to the army of Darius, who used them against Alexander's cavalry…

He took a napkin and drew on it a piece of iron with pointed tips. Such a piece, falling to the ground, would certainly put up one of its jagged spikes.

"It looks like an anti-tank hedgehog," I said. "When you drive to Sheremetyevo Airport, there are several of them by the highway. Only big ones."

"Is there a military base there?"

"No. WWII monument."

I loved this cross-cultural trans-epochal conversation over coffee and ice cream. 

"Do you put sugar in your coffee?" he asked in surprise.

"Yes," I said. "Today I want to afford myself everything."

"There are funny people here," he said. "When I was filling out documents for the car, two bearded men came up to me and asked -- where are you from? I thought if I said I was from America, they'd say something rude. And I answer: from California. He asked -- where is it? And the second one says -- oh, I remember, *Californication*. We were watching at the camp..."

"Californication," I repeated. "A beautiful word. There's something antlike about him. Was there such a TV series too?"

"Everything in the world is a TV series that has already been."

The Toyota really looked very old, even ancient. After opening the trunk, Frank threw our bags in there and said:

"Here are the arrow scratches."

"Maybe it's from the war thorns," I replied, "Maybe it's a Roman Toyota, not a Parthian one.

"You're smart," he nodded. "I didn't think of such a possibility. Farewell, Edessa!"

"Who are you talking to?" I asked.

"The city."

Harran was about an hour away, and I slept most of the time. A couple of times I woke up when Frank was slowing down. The road was empty despite the weekday morning, only a red scooter with two blue riders flashed in the rearview mirror, and a tractor with a trailer full of green hay crossed the road once.

Braking once again, Frank took out his phone and brought up a map on the screen. After studying it, he switched to the satellite view.

"Take a look. These are already Carrhae. That is, Harran. Does it remind you of anything?"

The satellite image looked like a green-tiled floor, which had been hammered for a long time: the neatly drawn fields were glossy tiles, and the gray traces of a hammer were human settlements. The largest of the dim dents upon zooming turned out to be Harran.

I told Frank about the hammer and the tile, but he didn't like the comparison. He frowned.

"No," he said. "Look, there's a round spot in the center of Harran. There are almost no houses. This is an old city -- it's similar in color and shape to the moon. Isn't it so?"

"Well, a lousy one is talking only about a bath," I translated the proverb into English not without effort.

"I don't have lice," Frank said.

"Such a pity," I said. "Caracalla must have had some."

"You're angry."

"I'm angry," I agreed. "That's true."

"Why are you angry?"

"I don't know," I said. "I'm not comfortable here. I'm even scared."

So it was, but I realized it only after hearing my own words.

"You just feel the energy of the place," Frank said. "It is incredibly powerful and ancient. And it conflicts with you because you conflict with it."

"Why do you think that?"

"You're fighting this place for me."

He meant it seriously. It seems that he really felt like a Caracalla. I even snorted with indignation.

"Fighting?! Let it take you away. If you feel better with each other."

"Don't be jealous," Frank said condescendingly.

I was ready to bite him, but the car was already moving, and it could be dangerous for teeth.

I'm not sure it was about the competition for Frank, but I really didn't like the place.

For thousands of years, the sun has scorched and, as it were, crushed all the surroundings, as if a secret biblical sin had occurred here in immemorial times, and since then God was burning out its traces with a nuclear explosion suspended in the sky. The sun, after all, is a nuclear explosion, I remembered, just very far and extremely long.

The feeling of ancient sin and lawlessness only intensified when we arrived in Harran. I saw gray-yellow clay buildings, similar in shape to lipstick rods dug into the ground. Frank, in full accordance with the precepts of the Vienna school, compared them to the warheads. Still, it is interesting to observe the distortions of perception caused by testosterone.

The conical houses seemed very old. Frank explained that this is the local architectural style -- it has been built here for several thousand years, and inside these clay chambers ("it's not really clay, but a mixture of clay, mud and hay") it's cool in any heat.
I didn't like these huts. They, like everything around them, seemed to remind of the ancient horror, forgotten by mankind quite recently and with great difficulty. The windows and doors were small, the houses clung to each other closely, like honeycombs, and there was no doubt that people existed in them on the rights of bees. In general, not the kind of antiquity that you want to touch in admiration. But Frank was happy.

When he braked again and stopped on the side of the road, the urge to bite him had already passed. He went back to the map on his phone.

"There should be a gas station here."

There was only an old wall and dust outside the window.

"Where?"

"You're looking the wrong way. Inside. There was a temple of the moon."

He poked his finger at the phone screen -- the round gray bald spot that reminded him of the moon. There really was a semicircle on the screen around her, like a wall, and next to it, not far away, was the icon of a gas station called "Herbalife Harran".

"Strange name for a gas station," I said. "Herbalife. I don't see any suitable buildings here. Why do you need a gas station? We have a full tank."

"You can buy water at the gas station. And there is always a toilet nearby."

"How little Americans know about the world," I sighed.

"Stay here," he said, "I'm going to scout."

He got out and went somewhere in the hot yellow haze. There was almost no one on the street. Frank was followed by a pair of bearded men in blue overalls. One of them was dragging a small coil of wire -- probably, I thought, repairing an ancient land line to the temple of the Moon. Apparently, there was life behind the wall after all.

Some time passed, bearded men in overalls appeared on the street again, got on a red scooter and drove away. Frank was still gone.

Five minutes passed, then ten. Then twenty. I called his number. No one answered.

I suddenly noticed that people appeared on the street, they were running to the passage in the wall where Frank disappeared. A gray-moustached, heavy Turk approached my car, looking like Ukrainian hetman, defected to Ottomans.

"Isn't that your friend there?" he said with an accent. "There's a disaster happened."

"In such a long cape?" I asked, still not believing my guess.

"Yes," the Turk replied. "He was murdered."
