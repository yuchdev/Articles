# Chapter 2
--

Daddy showed up – probably, he sensed that I was thinking about his pasta. He even came to my house. At first, I couldn't understand what it was all of a sudden, until he said himself. Thirty years. Well, yeah, the anniversary.

He didn't notice my birthdays before. But after all, the Russian businessman is mainly interested in the zeros to the right of the digit. There were no zeros for a long time.

– Whose paintings are these? – he asked from the doorway. – What a huge ones. Yours?

"They're not paintings," I said. – They are scenery for the play. I'm working on them".

– How do you carry them?

– They are folding up.

– Some kind of burdocks...

– It's the Grass of Oblivion - I said.

– Why?

– For ballet.

– What ballet?

– "Schrodinger's Cat and Chuang Tzu's butterfly in the Thickets of Oblivion Grass". The whole second act the cat catches a butterfly. This is for the second act.

– "I thought you're a singer" he said. – "Or are you an artist now?"

– "I'm an actress too. I'm dancing a spare butterfly. And she wrote the libretto partially. We do everything ourselves".

– Why is the whole room in rags? Do you sew suits?

– Nope. I mean, yes, but not only that. It's also for sale.

– Don't you have enough money? Mom takes for you too.[TODO:phrasing]

"I'm fine," I replied. – "I just like to sew. I can tailor you a coat too, like Chichvarkin's. You will come to the party meeting in it, and in a week you will peacefully move with your family to London. What d'you think?"

He shook his finger at me. Then he shook his head, sighed, and shook his finger again. Apparently, I touched some strings.

– I think you got sucked,– he said. – into a some shallow swamp. You need to unwind. Forget about all this. Rags, decorations. See the world while you still can. Let your mind clear. Maybe you'll find something better for yourself.

– Like a business secretary?

– Why secretary. You know English fluently, you can work anywhere abroad. You love Asia. Take India, for example. There will be opportunities soon. English is spoken in a lot of places.

"I like to do things with my hands," I said. – Well, or the body. Not in that sense, of course. And I would like to keep my head for myself.

– For deep thoughts about life?  he asked sarcastically.

– Well, sort of.

– My baby, you can't think about life sitting far from it. Life is what you do to the world, and the world does to you. Kind of like sex. And if you step aside and start thinking about it, the very subject of reflection disappears. There remains a void in the place of life. That's why all these contemplators who are sitting on their asses against the wall are talking about emptiness. They just ran out of life – but for some reason they think they understood everything about it. There's no sense in thinking about life. Life can only be lived.

By the way, he is not stupid at all, and sometimes says such things that I don't even understand how he gets back to his pasta from them. For example, now. If some Hindu teacher had said that on satsang, everyone would've quacked of administration for two weeks. There is no prophet in his own homeland.

– "Thinking, Dad, also means living," I replied. – And if you step away from the world, you don't even have to think. You may not be thinking at all and doing nothing at the same time. There will also be a life, just different. Not like yours.

– Yeah. Like yours.

I smiled. But not because he nailed it, but because I suddenly remembered my Antosha. Once during a long hallucinogenic session, he pronounced a wonderful phrase:

"I don't care what I do at all, as long as I don't have to wake up out of bed..."

What if Daddy have heard.

"I do, and quite a lot," I replied.

And she showed him her paint-stained hands. One of my fingers was cut and wrapped with a bandage.

– You're doing it,– he sighed. – But not what you need. Okay, you're already a big girl, why should I fix your head? I want to make you a gift.

– Which one?

- A travel.

I didn't understand at first.
 
– A travel?

– I told you, go clear your head. I'll give you the money.

– Where to?

– Wherever you want. There is only one condition. All the money I give you, you spend on the travel. No scenery, no theater and sewing projects, and so on. Do you agree?

– I travel where I want?

- Yes. But not in hostels for drug users, but on normal routes. Five stars, at least four. Look at the first world. You might want to be a part of it.

– And how much will you give me?

– Thirty. One for every year you've lived.

- "Dollars?"  I asked.

– "Euro", he smiled. – "It's definitely enough for a couple of months. If you save, then for six. But I just don't want you to save. I want you to get off the ugly hummock you're sitting on and forget about it. And when you arrive, we will make you to apply yourself, with the firm hands..."

Of course, I agreed. Not on firm hands, but on a trip.

The thing is, I knew where I was going.

I've been thinking about it for the last five years.

This was my chance to shake the beads. Or rather, one very interesting bead, perhaps the most beautiful and mysterious in all my necklace. A bead that no one else knew about.

Let me explain what I'm talking about.

The political scientist Egor, who once loved me and beerness (I'm sure he still loves it), loved to mock my spiritual, as he put it, wanderings. Especially when it was already becoming gradually clear to us that soon he would be left alone with the beerness of him.

"Look at you. You do yoga on the mat every day, as if you are praying. You were traveling in India to some muddy ashrams. You regularly pretend to meditate, and then you can't even creak a floorboard next to you. You read various esoteric bullshit, on which smart people earn money. Do you even understand what this is all about?"

"What?" I asked.

"Beads!" He held up a finger. "It's just your beads. A virtual bundle of spiritual treasures that you will present to your loving dear instead of a dowry in exchange for..."
  
Here he got confused, because his sarcasm abruptly ran out of fuel.

But the idea, of course, was interesting – and in a certain sense correct.

Not about a dowry, of course – this is nonsense. If I were in Yegor's place and wanted to make a fool of me competently, I would develop this idea like this:

– Here, Sasha, you're preening yourself in front of the mirror in the morning. Sometimes quite a long time. Does it happen?

– "And what?" I would ask.

But you put makeup on yourself [TODO:informal] in front of a physical mirror. You, like any other progressive girl, collecting of all the coolest, beautiful, cute and sonorous that the surrounding reality can offer, and decorate yourself with it. You make a kind of necklace out of awesome pebbles that you come across. One stone is yoga. The other is anapana. The third is some kind of holotropic breathing. The fourth is advaita. Books. Podcasts. Music. You collect it all on your thread because you want to be the most beautiful flower... and why do you want to be the most beautiful flower? For whom?

And the flower would definitely blush – and would not immediately find what to answer.

But now I already know. It seems to me that the desire to become a "beautiful flower" is the same law of nature as gravity. Beauty is one of the names of perfection. Only low people can look for something low in this. We preen up in front of the mirror not because we want to attract a male – only a cretin can say that.

The nature of a woman is to be beautiful. I want to like myself first. And if my reflection in the mirror suits me, then there will be no problems with the male for sure.

The same applies to cultural and spiritual jewelry, here Egor was right. But there is nothing shameful in this either.

We women (and men too) are blooming this way. We find our petals in the world around us – and decorate ourselves with the best of what the epoch could offer us. Not necessarily in order to attract someone for reproduction and sharing a property, although this is sometimes also the case. We are just fulfilling our function.

Flowers don't bloom for bees either. And not for poets. And not even for myself. They just open up to the world, and poets roam around, bees fly and political scientists Yegors crawl. A flower does not exist for something or someone in particular, but for everything at once. Different minds dissect it in different ways, and everyone will think that they have understood everything. Therefore, there are no complaints about Egor. He blooms with such brown semantic burrs, and they even buy them from him somewhere.

My wanderings, which he mocked, really took place. And I would add that at different times I was wanderings in different directions and at different angles.

It started with yoga, and I still do a few favorite exercises every morning – "greeting the sun" and asanas around. I used to be a fan of asanas, because it seemed to me that this was it: a couple of years on the mat, and all the secrets of the world would automatically be revealed, problems would disappear, and shining clarity would come. Alas, it did not come – but the good physical stretch remained.

Then there was anapana. Inhale-exhale meditation. A romance with the tip of your own nose. It ended like all my romances, we tired of each other, especially of me. No, everything was fine. It's just that... How should I say...

Imagine you started ironing the curtain, a day, two, a week passes – and then you gradually realize that this curtain stretches from you to the moon, and you should iron it all at least three times. It is necessary to subordinate your entire life to this, and it is not a fact that there will be a result. Moreover, compared to other options on the market, this is still a shorter way.

Then there were transurfing, mindfulness, Sufi dance, Dzogchen and something else the shortest and final from the Tibetan shop, I forgot the name.

It also hung on the necklace, sparkled and sparkles until now. Yes, a party acquaintance. Is there anything else in our brief urban lives? No. There are only beads. Only the threads on which the colorful show-offs.

If I were asked what I think about all these things[TODO:synonym] now, I would quote a very strange man named Hans-Friedrich, whom I met in India.

He put it something like this:

– A human is a mystery that has not yet been solved by anyone. You were born, you live, you grow up, and gradually you see that there are a lot of incomprehensible things in existence. In fact, it is one continuous mystery. But the world has long ago learned to catch people like you. As soon as you understand the nature of the riddle, a hundred different signs appear around you with the inscription "The Ultimate Exclusive Solution For Just Ridiculous Money". You approach one of the signs. There, in short, there is a shovel – and the instruction "to dig for a hundred years". Well, or wait a hundred years until everything is spontaneously dug out, just do not forget to donate for the temple... All these signs are also part of the labyrinth, elements of the world deception. They exist not to open your eyes, but to hide the secret deeper. To hide it forever. While you're looking for yourself, you can still find something by accident. And when you fell for one of these signs, you already found everything. You got a shovel and a place to dig, got a picture of a Wise Teacher to hang over your bed, and you can no longer repeat your childhood "Why?" and "For what reason?". Now you have to dig, dig, dig, because you have been given the answer. You were caught in a net, Sister...

Well, yeah, yeah. Take people without spiritual interests, are they busy with something else? Here's my dad. He digs with a shovel in the same way, only without any questions and answers. Just on the monetary and macaroni field.

After all, what is the end of any successful spiritual search? Yes, by the fact that a person says: "Aha!" – and then lives an ordinary human life from second to second, not sticking to anything much. He sees exactly the same as before, he hears too, he is still cold and hot (because there is no other way with people), and he even thinks the same way, only maybe less often and clearer. And then he dies the same way. He just doesn't have any more great questions. So my dad doesn't have them either. And what's the difference?

The famous Indian Saint Ramana Maharshi walked the earth like everyone else. Dad also walks on the ground. Or rather, he drives a Bentley along (a business necessity). They fly through the sky exclusively in Tibetan marketing.

"There is nothing special about flying," said the Indian Saint before drubchen, "there is nothing special..."

I met Hans-Friedrich just in the ashram of Ramana Maharshi. Or rather, not in the ashram itself, but in a hotel for pilgrims near Arunachala. I was twenty-five years old at the time
.
Arunachala is a sacred mountain where Ramana spent almost all his life. Ramana was really unrealistically cool.

For example, Mahayana Buddhists, with whom I hung out a lot in my youth, have a topic about "bodhisattvas". If you go to Tibetan choral singing or the so-called "Zen", you will definitely be [TODO:informal]treated with it someday.

The point is that the "bodhisattva" refuses final enlightenment and takes a solemn vow to be reborn in a world of suffering until all living things are saved.

When this was explained to Ramana Maharshi, he replied: "it's like saying, I take a vow not to wake up until all those whom I see in my dream wake up too"

I remember it struck me. I even read a little on this topic later – it turns out that Gautama Buddha himself did not teach anything like that, but they came up with it much later: such a sentimental medieval new age, which for some reason was also called "the teaching of the Buddha".

It's not surprising that it took root – it's much easier to collect donat under this [TODO:informal]. After all, we like to hear that someone will come from eternity/infinity to save us. And the teachings that do not collect donat do not live long. You have to be a Ramana Maharshi to be able to use a shovel with one powerful blow...

In general, it is clear why I wanted to go to his ashram at the age of twenty–five - and why people still go there, although Ramana has long since stopped seeing all of us in his dreams.
