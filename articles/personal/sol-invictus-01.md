# Chapter 1
--

I decided to meet my thirtieth birthday, riding down the highway on a motorcycle.

I love all kinds of symbolism. I mean, when life rhymes. It even seems to me that these rhymes can be forged -- this is a kind of magic called sympathetic, and it's very sympathetic to me. We sort of explain to the thick-assed, clumsy fate what we want her to look like, and sometimes she takes the hint.

But not always, which I'll come back to soon.

Technically, my project was feasible simply. My mom remembered the time of my birth as "somewhere between five and six in the evening" -- and it will be enough for me to spend about an hour in the saddle.

I borrowed a Tiger motorcycle, helmet and leather jacket from my rocker friend, whom everyone called "Lynx" (she even had a passport in that name, it seems). At first, Lynx flatly refused, but when I honestly explained to her what was the matter, she got into it and took pity. She understands such things.

Lynx is only ten years older than me, but she behaves like my mother, although she herself believes that this is the modus of an older sister.

"Oh, my girl," she said, crossing her arms over her chest, "and this is a serious milestone. A thirty-year-old in the patriarchal pedophile dictatorship of the third world is the reason to reflect on the passing time. And over the irreversible fate of the female body…"

I showed her the "OK" sign with my fingers. As a conscious and progressive woman, I demonstrate a ring made of a thumb and index, instead of the patriarchal middle one, known as a "finger". Not everyone can understand. Lynx understood, of course -- but this won't be enough to confuse her.

"Do you know what's next?" she continued with care in her voice. "You will gradually fall out of the pedophile hunting field. Then you will notice biological changes. Your skin, metabolism, that's all. Self-esteem will collapse. Then you can easily become a psychiatric patient. In general, if you don't meet yourself in time, it could turn ugly..."

"Meet yourself -- how do you mean?"

"For example, I met myself on the highway", aid Lynx and scratched her red hedgehog-styled hair, "and we haven't been apart since. But any advice in this matter is inappropriate".

"Why?" I asked, although I already guessed what she would say.

"Because", replied Lynx, "people demand to tow them out of the shit so that there was someone to blame for their failure. I've been through it myself…"

She handed me the keys.

"If you crash, don't come back".

This was not part of my plans. I used to ride motorbikes quite well once -- and I was sure that since my first Asian trip, the laws of physics did not have a chance to change much.

Lynx entrusted me with her motorcycle for just a couple of hours, so I was in a hurry. The plan was to go to Kashirskoe Highway, and accelerate to the Domodedovo International Airport. So to speak, perform the symbolic speedup and take-off.

But there was a traffic jam -- several cars collided at once, the traffic stalled, and precious minutes would have passed waiting for the police. Therefore, at the last moment, I turned to the ring motorway, but there was also a traffic jam, although not so hopeless.

I rode pretty deep into it, maneuvering between cars and listening to a monotonous patriarchal swearing, until I realized that celebrating the anniversary on the ring motorway is a rather dubious symbolic decision. Even, probably, more dubious than just waiting for the cops. But it was too late.

I returned the bike in a foul mood.

If you want symbols, life said, I have them... and what hurts the most is that the symbolism was quite accurate. That's how it was.

I also met myself on the highway, just not in that optimistic sense that Lynx was talking about. A great reason to rethink what was happening to me -- and why, instead of an arrow-straight runway in his thirties, Sasha Orlova rides in a traffic jam around the ring motorway, maneuvering between not particularly handsome male faces.

This is how you try to explain something to Life, and she explains it to you instead. After all, life also loves hints and rhymes.

A thirty-year-old anniversary for a girl is still a serious milestone. Let's say, you are not completely "falling out of the pedophile hunting field" (here Lynx, of course, was talking about her sore and personal matters), but some serious symptoms are evident.

I think anyone can feel them. Especially, as it was correctly noted, in a patriarchal third world dictatorship, where girls are taught from childhood to be aware of their commodity value (because they simply do not have any other) and compete unconsciously with other girls for an imaginary male, even in the female prison.

No, at thirty you're still beautiful, fresh, and they give you twenty-two, then twenty-five. But you're not stupid, because you see real twenty-year-olds next to you. And you think -- oh God, what rude ugly whores, and they even look older than their twenties, how awful... Well, you don't always think like that of course, but quite often, and this is a bad sign.

Because when you were twenty, you glanced at thirty-year-olds and called them "witches" to yourself. And now you've swapped places. No, you are not a "witch" yet, but you are no longer the raw dough from which your life is inspiringly sculpting some cake. At the age of thirty, you are already a baked loaf of bread...

Here is the word - a loaf. At twenty, your dough is still rising, gaining height, and even if everyone around you says that there is a stove further along the conveyor, this "there" is not here yet.

And at thirty there is no "there" anymore. At thirty, it turns out that you've already been baked. And even though everything is fine and very sunny, life is getting more exciting every day and you can improve yourself with one hundred and eight different methods, if you have time and money, in fact, it is already clear what's next and how it will be.

Everything will remain the same, it's only every day your loaf will become a little staler, life would pinch off a piece from you, and in the end there will remain only an old breadcrumb. 

Everything is predictable and linear.

Males in the pedophile third-world patriarchy, of course, have slightly different routes, but we have what we have -- and occasional beautiful exceptions from women's fashion websites only confirm the rule. Lynx is right. She's smart. And she has already been where I am now.

It feels like your motorbike used to go uphill and everything ahead was hidden behind a huge rock (I know a place like this in Goa) -- and then you ride around it, and the road is now visible far, far ahead. It goes down, and it's even not that boring to drive along it -- but you don't squeal with joy anymore, turning the motorbike's steering wheel.

On the other hand, at thirty you become smarter. Well, or so you foolishly think.

Actually, I don't have reasons to complain. Oddly enough, my age benefited me greatly.

It often happens that at the age of thirty, a "girl" is already more a "lady", especially if she got a hairy husband and children on the way, who drain the poor mom dry every day. But it seems to me that the main point here is not so much about exploitation, but rather in genes. Genes decide everything. 

At twenty, I was pretty, but slightly chubby -- a cute half-childish face, looking more like a kitten than a human. At that time, I loved editing my photos like that -- a red button on my nose and three black lines on my cheeks, kitten whiskers.

We didn't know back then that this was a symbolic indulgence of objectifiers, who see a woman exclusively as a pussy, in a technical sense. Or probably, somewhere deep down, we knew it -- and deliberately indulged them anyway.

After all, as long as you are young and beautiful, patriarchy does not seem so terrible and there is no solidarity between girls who are in high demand and those who are no longer there. This is bad -- but, alas, we understand this only over time, when we move into the second category, as Lynx constantly says. It's supposed to be a smiling emoji here, but it won't be.

By the time I turned thirty, I became slimmer. I don't have particularly large breasts at all, which is good, because time is merciless to the big-breasted beauty standard. Melons spoil quickly, oranges and lemons are preserved better. Some girls with a first and even second size, as I remember, did a boob job ten years ago. Among my friends as many as two (now both have already taken the silicon out). What do you have to think to end up with such a surrender… As a politician of Imperial Russia Pavel Milyukov once asked, is this stupidity or marketing?

The main problem is that everything is done for the sake of the male -- but you will not delight him in this way, because he's not really allowed to grab these places. Males constantly mistake female breasts for their weights in the gym, and no implant can withstand this. In general, it's not my interest at all, and I don't even understand why I was distracted by it. Probably, I thought about it once, but the Lord took away from sin. Thank you!

The most pleasant age transformation happened to my face -- it dried up, tightened, lost excessive fats and became... myself. As the bodybuilder Petya said (I'll tell you more about him), "when one looks at you, at first it seems that you are only half beautiful. Well, I mean as you are beautiful, but not completely. And it immediately pushes to come up to you, hug you and forgive..."

There's actually quite a long line of them, those who want to come up and forgive everything.

To be honest, if you compare me at twenty and me at thirty, I like the second option much more. And others too. As one girlfriend put it, "a mug turned into an amphora". Probably she pointed at the ancient age, but I understood it positively.

That's just there is a downside to this. When I was twenty, the current me was ahead of me at twenty. And what's ahead of the current me?

I'm practically a blonde. Well, if you fine-tune it a little. When six months ago I cut my hair above my shoulders and made myself a high-quality fleece like "six months in Goa" (not to be confused with the "goodbye youth" baby lights), there was nothing left of the old Sasha. And it turned out so much... Well, just really-really. They started calling me to auditions, filming and traveling -- the patriarchy specifically pointed its sniffling telescope at me. Not meant to lie, it's always nice to hear. Even when you don't particularly love this very patriarchy.

We must always remember, Sister, that physical attractiveness is a weapon in our struggle. I'm kidding. Or maybe not.

Unfortunately, I'm not a lesbian. Or rather, not a complete lesbian. Or rather, as Venichka Yerofeyev said, complete, but not finished. I tried, I tried more than once, but unluckily, I could not go in this direction with my whole being. I say "unfortunately" because it would solve many moral and interpersonal problems and would be much more aesthetically pleasing. But I am, as they say, straight as a rail.

I mean our domestic-made rails, of course. That is, I'm straight by seventy percent. Or sixty-five.

Boys. I can't say much about them, but they deserve a couple of lines. I don't really get along with boys for a long time. And except for one exception, I'm the one who says "goodbye".

No, they like me, they court me, give me flowers and so on. But then, when begins, as my mother puts it, "the joint conduct of chaos", I quickly get bored. As Lynx said on this occasion, the secret of a stable relationship with a man is to have time to feel a piercing woman's pity for him before he begins to cause severe domestic disgust. She's able to make it, but I don't.

A man, in my opinion, is capable of politeness and tenderness only at his hormonal peak - it takes him just a couple of times to release pressure, and a pig inevitably wakes up in him. A well-mannered male simply masks his piggy better and longer, but this cute animal is always there.

One very adult man told me an interesting thing at the time: a man does not pay for sex. A man pays for a woman to get dressed quickly and leave after sex. Let's take chauvinism out of the brackets of this testosterone wisdom -- and unfortunately, we'll get the naked truth.

If you use the clerical language from the domestic doctrine about eros, a man is capable of tenderness, interest and warmth only as a "foreplay". This is true, any girl with brains after thinking for five minutes will find a hundred proofs.

All his cute manifestations, including expensive gifts and even sudden bouquets of white roses for your twenty-seventh and a half anniversary, are strictly preliminary. Not in the sense that he is prudently calculating the outcome. It's just that he becomes romantic, gentle and generous only when the boner kicks him to become so -- and the pituitary gland, or whatever they have hanging between their legs, injects a stream of proper hormones into his brain.

Male tenderness is such a tugboat plying between the letters "P" and "S". You are either an acutely necessary pussy, or an annoying sassy, when you dare to remind him about your needs. Kind of a bag with bricks, to which decency or habit binds him.

In the worst case, in the second part of the cyclorama, he becomes rude and arrogant, at best he becomes condescending. Con-des-cend-ing, even when he has even fewer convolutions than banknotes. Kitty, are you still here? Here's a ball for you, play there quietly.

The most terrible thing is that you become such a kitty, because your nature is plastic and flexible -- and when he finally unmasked to the extent of sticking out in front of you like an iron bar in a toilet (an ideal natural philosophical description of the manhood), you can envelop and bend this very bar in hundreds of different ways.

The guy is cyclical, like a washing machine. His personality is usually a poorly written piece of software to a small member. And you are calm, smooth, deep and constant (if you exclude three days in a month) -- but you have to get along somehow. So you play with a ball for a while, and then you just stop answering his calls.

Furthermore, he does not even call, because he "corrects the balance of significance" after watching to a femophobic lecture on YouTube by some master of express-seduction, who's still considering is it okay to open there a parallel channel "lifehacks for gays".

I have discussed these topics with Lynx, and here we have a complete consensus. Only she believes that in the pedophile patriarchy of the third world, a woman must inevitably accept a freak snoring next to her, and I don't think so -- but we just have different life circumstances.

My actual one, Antosha, considers himself a musician. Moreover, he is also a poet and a writer too. That's true, sometimes he creates quite good poems, but "poet", in my opinion, is not so much the ability to rhyme words as the general vector of your soul. Antosha is a distinctive prosaist in this sense.

He is five years younger than me, plays bass in the Existential Abyss and at the same time writes lyrics for them (I'm not kidding -- their band is really called "ExAb", and at each concert the vocalist has to decipher their name).

He writes a little better than he plays. For the last six months, he has been busy writing a book based on the ancient Japanese epic genre, short prose passages with poems built-in. Monogatari, as he puts it. Even his poems are longer than in Japanese epic, but sometimes it comes out quite nice.

Sometimes he lives with his parents, sometimes is renting. We meet on my territory -- I have a wonderful studio apartment, thanks to my mom. Sometimes I let him sleep there. But not too often, in order not to make him get used to it.

For some reason, his mustache touches me. It is still half-childish, soft, and not even completely dark.

He is constantly trying to play his music to me -- and I ask him not to push me off an existential cliff. I did go to his concert once, there were a lot of different bands there, ExAb had only one song. They were singing something about "fucking under speed" -- and at first I thought it was about the sex under the riding train. 

He explained later it's about drugs, and even showed it. By the way, he is constantly trying to get me high on weed, ecstasy, or amphetamines. Tried to offer heroin once, but was beaten badly. And this famous "fuck under speed", in my opinion, is technically possible only between two women - according to the results of our experiments, I can say that under its influence a male dick turns into a soft silky cloth, which is good to wipe glasses or polish spoons.

However, occasionally he showed me something useful. For example, insert the phrase *emoji_(required_text).png.* into all sorts of online statuses, emails, and even into these notes.

This is a verbal description of an emoji picture in the *.png* format, almost as if it's blowing over the reader with the hot wind of the Silicon Desert. A kind of underground resistance to the mainstream. I really like this joke, I constantly abuse it, and I'm going to abuse it in the future.

Antosha doesn't know yet, but we will break up soon, because of his drugs and in general.

As one evangelist noticed, every girl who looks at her man with an appraising look has already broken up with him in her soul. Antosha does not need a girlfriend, he needs a new mother, and it seems to me he believes he has already found her. A learning experience for me.

You know how it happens, you give birth to such a baby, and then you spend your whole life working to support him and guessing where to settle him. And the worst thing, is to love him.

No, I also love Antosha, in theory. My heart, even in idle, gives a small positive exhaust, and whoever is caught in will be quite loved, but temporarily, and become quickly replaceable, like a tire. But mom will love her spoiled baby genuinely and unconditionally. That is the fatal passion, which will turn your life upside down and burn your whole soul.

Before Antosha there was Petya. Two years older than me, a fanatical jock. Also, a drug addict by the way, only he's addicted not to "speed", but to hormones and anabolics, and it is still a big question about which is more harmful to health. Petya hated conventional drugs and even once read me a quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger's monumental work about bodybuilding:

"If some people still think that marijuana, amphetamines or cocaine will help them develop outstanding muscles, and even more to become champions, they live in a world of illusions".

Write it down in big letters and put it on the wall! I really like this quote. I keep forgetting to tell Antosha, and then it will be too late.

By the way, if some girls still think that a big muscular male is somehow particularly interesting as a lover, then they live in a world of illusions. It all depends on when he's injecting himself with testosterone, because his own has been suppressed for a long time. You need to know his schedule and scheme. Men are cyclical, and jocks are particularly. However, Petya often took revenge with his tongue, the second unpaired muscle, which he did not exercise in the gym. It worked much better than the first one.

Looks like I mention this first muscle too often - it may give the impression that I think about it too much and somehow depend on it existentially. Not at all. Before Petya, I had Masha, and this muscle was missing there. And not once, I repeat, not once did I cry about it.

There is another problem with girls. A man is still a stranger (the word "hunter" is an incorrect outdated translation, because he will send you to hunt). You keep a distance with the stranger, and distance creates tension and interest. Therefore, you can play a game of relationship with a man, that is, being kind or evil, being cunning, flirting, pushing your line, or giving in gently. Sometimes it could be fun.

And when two girls (I'm not talking about the case when one of them is a total boy inside) are in a close relationship, after a while they begin to feel and understand each other so well that they communicate almost without words, telepathically. Anyway, that's how it was for me both times. A year after the beginning of our tender friendship, Masha and I were not talking at all -- we only exchanged quick interjections, and sometimes just glances. That was enough.

And you begin to get tired of this very thing, that you no longer have your own private inner space, but have one common space for two. At some point, it becomes unbearable. No man will drive you crazy that deep, because he won't get that close to you in ten years, and in the most alarming case, he will purr drunkenly, looking for you under the nearest street lamp, because it's brighter there. And the girl knows where you are, down to the micron.

That's why I say that lesbi is not really for me, even though sex in such a relationship is much more interesting, more cosmic, longer, gentler, etc, underline what you want to choose. I would introduce Solomon's rule: after every two boys, I need one girl for rehabilitation, only for a short time. No more than six months.

Before Masha there was Egor, I don't even want to talk about him. A young "political scientist" with an eternal beer. Which he also called "beerness", once you heard it, it is impossible to forget this word ever. How could one sink so low? I'm not talking about him, but about myself, for him it was a rise to the skies. Before Egor was Kolya, he was okay, but he moved to his tricky and not completely honest Belarusian parents who lived in Israel.

Before Kolya was Dima, and in parallel with him was Lena, with whom we also became telepaths in a week. Back then everyone was still so young that no one had any professions, only nicknames. And before that, my Asian trip happened with all the proper adventures, and if looking even earlier, the radioactive desert of youth stretches, almost childhood, where there were no "partners", but only a joint study of cigarettes, alcohol, drugs and physical sexuality, one's own and someone else's.

After all, there is not even anything to repent of.

Even though I'm almost in my thirties, my parents support me fifty percent. I earn some myself by *haute couture* (I'm sewing various little things, and sell them in online stores quite well, dream catchers especially), sometimes by "theatrical activities" (I participate in two theater companies at once, we perform at all sorts of children's parties, park concerts, and so on). I was paid once for backing vocals on a studio recording. I was dreaming of a singer career, but I sing badly. I needed some serious psychological help to finally admit it. But the world is not without kind people. Thank you.

As my dad summed it up, "without certain occupation".

Well, yes, if you put it like that. But I think that pretty soon I'll be able to increase my income to a completely acceptable level on one of the tracks I'm running on now. If the circumstances were tougher, I would've found a way earlier, but my parents are alright with the money, and it's not difficult for them to help me from time to time. Or rather, it's the Dad who's alright, and therefore mom and I are not bad as well, although she's no longer with him, and I'm no longer with her.

My dad is the pasta king. Or rather, not a king, but a duke or count. The king is someone else -- he told me, I don't remember. But Dad has his own bakeries, flour mills, and so on, the list is quite long.

He really started with the pasta, although now he invests in heavy industry, in the hotel business, and somewhere else. How much money he has, I do not know, in such areas, people don't have money, they are draping in them, if you say, or swim in it, constantly pretending they dive extremely deep, although in fact they only crawl in the shallows on their bellies.

He recently lost something in Ukraine, but gained something in Brazil. He has another family and new children, and my mother and I, as they say in business circles, are not an asset, but a liability. I rarely see him, my mother milks him on my behalf, who also has another family and other children. In general, it's not even the splashes of champagne that reach me, but the smells of someone else's burp, but I don't complain, and really hope that I will soon be able to do well even without it.

I wanted to write about my parents more, but I probably won't. Thank them for everything, long life and eternal memory. I have almost forgiven them for the horrible crime of my birth into this world.
