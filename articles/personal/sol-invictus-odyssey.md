*Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims fast,<br>
and I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip,<br>
dug a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length<br>
and around it poured libations out to all the dead...<br>

I would offer a sleek black ram,<br>
the pride of all my herds. And once my vows<br>
and prayers had invoked the nations of the dead,<br>
I took the victims, over the trench I cut their throats<br>
and the dark blood flowed in—and up out of Erebus they came,<br>
flocking toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone<br>
Brides and unwed youths, and old men who had suffered much<br>
and girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow<br>
and great armies of battle dead, stabbed by bronze spears,<br>
men of war still wrapped in bloody armor - thousands<br>
swarming around the trench from every side<br>
unearthly cries - blanching terror gripped me!<br>
I ordered the men at once to flay the sheep<br>
that lay before us, killed by my ruthless blade,<br>
and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods,<br>
to the almighty Hades and dread Persephone.<br>
But I, the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip,<br>
sat down on alert there and never let the ghosts<br>
of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood<br>
till I had questioned Tiresias myself...*
