# Odyssey

Perimedes and Eurylochus held the sheep,<br>
our sacrificial victims, while I unsheathed<br>
the sharp sword on my thigh and dug a hole,<br>
two feet each way. I poured out libations<br>
to all the dead—first with milk and honey,<br>
second with wine, and a third with water.<br>
Around the pit I sprinkled barley meal.<br>
Then to the helpless heads of the departed<br>
I offered many prayers, with promises<br>
I’d sacrifice, once I returned to Ithaca,<br>
the finest barren heifer in my home,<br>
and load the altar with fine gifts, as well.<br>
To Teiresias in a different sacrifice<br>
I’d offer up a ram, for him alone,<br>
the finest in my flocks. With prayers and vows<br>
I called upon the families of the dead.<br>
Next, I held out the sheep above the hole,<br>
slit their throats, and let the dark blood flow.<br>

Then out of Erebus came swarming up<br>
shades of the dead—brides, young unmarried men,<br>
old ones worn out with toil, young tender girls,<br>
with hearts still new to grief, and many men<br>
wounded by bronze spears, who’d died in battle,<br>
still in their blood-stained armour. Crowds of them<br>
came thronging in from all sides of the pit,<br>
with amazing cries. Pale fear seized my heart.<br>
Then I called my comrades, ordering them<br>
to flay and burn the sheep still lying there,<br>
slain by cruel bronze, and pray to the gods,<br>
to mighty Hades and Persephone.<br>
And then I drew the sharp sword on my thigh<br>
and sat there, stopping the powerless heads<br>
of all the dead from getting near the blood,<br>
until I’d asked Teiresias my questions.<br>
