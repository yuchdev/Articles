# Chapter 11


Playing with the Moon in my dream, I moved the stone tiles on the ground until they folded into a sundial. We did it in many different ways, and all the time the Moon looked at me reproachfully from under her mask -- as if regretting my lack of foresight.

Something was required of me, but I didn't understand what. Approach? I wanted to, but I couldn't -- the rules of our game didn't allow that.

I had this dream as often as a murderer dreams of his crime, and one day, after completing another puzzle, I guessed what was the matter.

There was no sun in the sky above us.

The sundial turned out to be a mockery. Or maybe a complaint. The moon has looked at me for so many nights with expectation, and maybe with contempt for my stupidity. And I was the Sun. Or rather, I considered myself to be.

When I realized this, shame was born in my heart, which in a second became a rattling mixture of passion and anger. This feeling ignited me, as it were, and I turned into a radiance that tore apart the dim night. It didn't last long, but nothing more beautiful had ever happened to me before, either in a dream or in reality.

This was our first real intercourse, the traces of which I saw on the sheet when I woke up. After that, all the earthly surrogates of my heavenly half became completely boring to me.

There were vile rumors about me that I was sleeping with my mother; one of the advisers, a Greek, urged me not to fight them, because for the rabble it was the best confirmation of my divinity.

There was another rumor -- that I had completely lost my manhood and was only able to give myself to my soldiers and charioteers. For these gossips, I crucified several people and punished the whole city, although the same Greek assured that the soldier's love from such stories only grows, because this is how the military brotherhood has been strengthened since the time of Achilles and Epaminondas, not to mention Alexander and Caesar.

In fact, it was both funny and sad. I could afford everything, but there were no temptations left in the world that were attractive to me. My father would have rejoiced to know that even when I ascended the throne, my noble abstinence resembles of Marcus Aurelius.

My tastes were uncomplicated. According to my drawings, two masks were made for me from a thin electron, similar to those that I saw in a dream. The alloy of gold and silver is the union of the sun of metals with their moon, the jeweler told me.

The mask of the Moon was worn by a girl or a young man (depending on my mood and the weather -- doctors say that on a cold, damp day, boys are more useful for health, and women are preferable in the heat). Anyone with a good body. Often I didn't even see their faces: they were coming to me in a mask, they also coming out. I myself wore a Sun mask so that the guests would not understand that they were facing the emperor and would not try to kill me.

I did not have castrated favorites, like Nero and Hadrian, and did not look for special pleasure in relationships, but only got rid of the itch of the flesh. So did Marcus Aurelius.

I knew that the goddess was waiting in the East. When the affairs of the empire finally called me to the places where my father once fought, I submitted to fate with joy and hope, not least because the climate of Rome is disastrous for emperors.

Senators who liked to repeat this joke soon found out that it also applies to them. And I left for Asia to join my soldiers.

In the simplicity of my life, I surpassed even Augustus. I baked my own bread, cooking it from flour in just enough quantity to satisfy my hunger. The soldiers liked it; those who hoped to poison me hardly did so. I preferred the same food that they ate in the camp. On the march I walked among the soldiers; sometimes I carried the legion's eagle, and in the heat it was a serious challenge. In addition, I always had a shield and a sword with me.

Among the emperors, however, they were picked up by many. Commodus acted as a secutor in the circus and perfectly mastered these two tools -- only when he was strangled, neither a sword nor a shield were at hand.

My father often repeated that the history of Rome was decided when the Parthians killed Crassus and his son. If Crassus had not been killed at Carrhae, it is not known what was the subsequent fate of Caesar and Pompey. Crassus was richer than Pompey and more popular than Caesar; had he returned to Rome victorious, we would still be serving the Senate.

The Battle of Carrhae was considered even more important by my father than the battles with Hannibal, and one of his favorite amusements was to reproduce it on a reduced scale. I have seen this performance several times. The very first time I was so small that I was scared and cried; the last time I understood what was happening so well that I got bored.

It was in Britain, on one of the darkly cool, as if lunar days, which give the island its barbaric charm.

My father lined up the Legio II Augusta -- "Legio-Secundo-Augusta," as he repeated, clearly as if trying every word by the teeth, and announced that a battle with the Parthians would be played. We did not like this legion and did not trust it after it supported Clodius Albius; I think that father decided to combine his pleasure with the humiliation of others.

I remember how the soldiers lined up in a field in a huge square with a void in the center, and covered themselves with shields, forming a kind of long turtle (I wanted to say "snake", but there is no such order). It was an outlandish formation, not accepted in modern tactics, but two and a half centuries ago they fought and thought differently.

I wondered if, going back in time, Crassus would end up in the middle of the bridge connecting Alexander and me. What a hoary antiquity!

One of the legates, disguised as Crassus, was hiding inside the infantry square with his entourage, in which his father had placed several eunuchs for a laugh. Crassus was wearing yellow feathers. The officer, dressed up as his son, wore blue feathers, both of them darted among people and wagons, giving orders. There was also a small detachment of cavalry.

And then the Parthian cavalry appeared -- fake cataphracts and archers. Arrows without tips were prepared for them for a whole month, my father told me that the Parthians had a lot of arrows under the Carrhae, and camels loaded with them rode behind each turma of horsemen. In Britain, camels were portrayed by donkeys.

The horsemen began to bombard the Second Legion with arrows, and I could have sworn that my father's face stretched into a satisfied grin. Arrows, of course, did not kill or even maim, but they could knock out the eye completely, and spending a few hours under such a wooden rain was akin to flogging.

Then, just like in ancient times, the Parthians began to falsely retreat, the Second Legion began to move, its square formation broke apart, and our cavalry chased after the Parthians. In front rode a horseman with blue feathers on his helmet, playing the Crassus Junior. After letting him hide behind the hills, the "Parthians" soon returned from there with a large pumpkin on a peak. Blue feathers were tied to the pumpkin, it depicted the severed head of a young Crassus.

Just a few years ago, Pertinax's head was carried around Rome on the same exact peak -- and he was emperor for the whole three months. I'm sure everyone thought about it, and first of all, my father.
The rider in yellow feathers, representing the elder Crassus, fell to the ground and began to roll on it in a fake mountain. We watched the performance from the hill; my father laughed, but I was saddened.

I didn't know much about Mesopotamia, and I began to make up for what I had missed by asking those who had served there for a long time. The first thing I found out struck me to the core.

In Carrhae, where Crassus was killed, the oldest Eastern temple of the Moon was located. It has existed there for centuries, if not thousands of years. My father was even surprised that I hadn't heard about it.

"Didn't your mother tell you?"

I immediately saw the Battle of Carrhae with different eyes.

The square formation of the soldiers, which looked more like a something in between a square and a circle, began to seem to me an image of the Sun, large enough to be seen from the sky; the defeat and death of Crassus seemed to me a great sacrifice in the Lunar temple…

I could not openly worship the Moon, and instead, as my father prescribed, I favored the cults of Mithra and Serapis. But my heart was already in the Carrhae.

I knew that fate would lead me to Parthia. My father prepared me for this. Do not repeat the mistakes of others, he said, be in Parthia not Crassus, but Alexander…

When my father died, neither I nor Geta, who by that time had become the second Caesar, wanted to continue the war for the north of Britain. Let Caledonia separate, and live as they know. I quickly made peace (the Caledonian barbarians were sure that they were saved thanks to their swamp gods), the legions retreated behind Hadrian's Wall, and my brother and I went to Rome.

When I said I was defending myself, I wasn't lying. My brother was plotting my murder, and I was ahead of him only quite a bit, his people showed it under torture. Unfortunately, the scorpion that survived is always declared a villain; a dead scorpion remains an innocent victim in human memory. But you can burn out this memory itself, and it's not too difficult. When the surgeon cuts off the gangrenous limb, the wound is cauterized. When one of the heads of the empire is cut off, much more red-hot iron is needed.

Rome became quiet. At first, out of fear. And when I defeated the insolent Germans and strengthened the northern border, respect was added to the fear.
The emperor, as my father used to say, can choose Rome or a province as his home. Tiberius said that running an empire was like holding a wolf by the ears. If you do it among the Roman excesses, it will be easier for the wolf to break out and bite.
Life in Rome is the path of Caligula, Nero and Commodus, and it ends the same way as their destinies. Life in the provinces, among the legions, is the fate of Marcus Aurelius and my father. My brother managed to walk along the first path, he had fun, but not for long. I chose the second one for myself.

My father wanted me to become the new Alexander. But what did it mean in our days?

I could not create an empire, it already existed; I could only repeat what Alexander did. I copied his habits and manners. I even restored the Macedonian phalanx in Legio II Parfica, although this tactic was considered outdated.

By the way, I didn't agree with that at all. Perhaps the phalanx was not suitable for Germany or Gaul with their swamps and forests, but nothing better has been invented for the desert where the Crassus and his son were killed. If our troops had formed a long phalanx that day, the shield-bearers would have covered the flanks, and then the cavalry would have gone behind the Parthians and driven them to long spears, everything would have ended differently.

Besides the phalanx, Alexander had two more secrets.

He was extremely pious, and always negotiated with the gods first, and then with people. Moreover, he prayed to both his own gods and to foreign ones. This I learned from him without difficulty.

It was more difficult with the second secret.

Alexander has never been afraid to get dirty in blood, rightly believing that a whore-history will condemn only losers. I didn't have the determination to be like him in this; my natural gentleness, hidden under a soldier's grin, prevented me. Alexander was gentle in face and cruel in heart.

The city of his name, Alexandria, was the source of the most vile insults that rumor rewarded me with. If they called me Oedipus, hinting at a fictitious incestuous relationship between me and my mother, I could bear it. To endure spitting and insults is the lot of all emperors nowadays. But they, what was especially meanly, aimed at my mother, calling her Jocasta.

I happened to get into intimacy with beautiful young relatives, which was, of course, slightly reprehensible. But I felt only reverence for my mother and endless guilt that my brother died in her arms, splattering her face with our common blood. Me and her on the same bed? After Geta's death?

There were too many funny men in Alexandria. And also there were too many philosophers in this city.

Most of them were followers of Aristotle, who, according to rumors, poisoned Alexander in Babylon through his messengers. I quite supposed this, because philosophy allows you to justify any crime with some magnificent phrase; a murderer and a rebel will always find a reliable assistant in a philosopher if he can pay for his services.

I didn't like philosophers. Even the work of Marcus Aurelius, which I should have studied according to family tradition, was not given to my understanding. Or rather, I agreed with everything the reader was saying, but an hour later I could not remember a single thought: in my memory they all boiled down to the same thing: "The good is that which is good."

Philosophers argue that there is a good; Caesars know it already. Unlucky, both the first and the second rarely find it. But Caesars at least openly grab this world by the ears, while philosophers constantly trade in the shadow of something that not only does not belong to them, but does not actually cast any shadow.

My father used to repeat one phrase of Marcus Aurelius: philosophers, like emperors, practice adoption, but this adoption is in the spirit, and their true offspring does not come from the loins, but from the heart and head.

Marcus himself, however, chose the loins, and made the Caesar his son Commodus, to whom the circus was destined. According to the logic of Marcus himself, Commodus could not possibly be his descendant. But he was. The father was not, although Marcus officially adopted him from the afterlife, thanks to Roman lawyers. My father tried to live a righteous life, but in anger he was cruel. So the only thing he had in common with Marcus was a full beard.

If the descendants of the philosophers are their followers, I thought, we can take revenge on Alexander's murderer by trampling his descendants... and at the same time I will remind the Alexandrian jokers of Jocasta.

I remember those fat cowards who came out of their city to greet the emperor they spat on. They could barely hide their haughty smiles, they were probably making up a new story about Oedipus and his mother. How their faces changed when the soldiers drew their swords! I only regretted that I could not direct my phalanx of Legio II Parfica at these dirty eunuchs, pinning them with cavalry from behind. That's when Alexander's spirit would have rejoiced to the fullest.

I did the same with Alexandria as Alexander did with Thebes, who insulted him. No one has condemned Alexander; they will not condemn me either, for I will surpass him in feats. I did not sell the inhabitants into slavery, as Alexander did -- let history remember my mercy.

The fire was enough for me, the glow was visible even from the camp. The city was plundered like an enemy fortress taken from battle. And they also decimated all the philosophers in there. Let's see, I thought, if there will be less good in the world after that, or no one will notice anything.

The very eastern road to glory finally opened before my legions, along which Alexander, Crassus, then my father, and many other men walked. As in the past, is passed through Parthia. The whole empire knew about my campaign. But no one knew that I was secretly waiting only for a meeting with my deity in the Carrhae.

I remembered this while drinking with soldiers and destroying the tombs of the Parthian kings (the living kings were hiding from me in the mountains). The Carrhae were getting closer every day.

When I stopped at Edessa, a priest from the temple of the Moon has been brought to me. It was an old Persian who looked like Darius, as he is depicted on bath mosaics. Nowadays, however, many Romans look like this, a long beard and oriental caps are in fashion with us.

"The Lord of the night is waiting for you," the Persian said when we were alone.

Lord of the night. Well, yes, one of the titles of Lunus. A lady would have been more suitable for me, but in Asia the Moon was a man. It's hot in here, I thought. The doctors won't be happy.

"How do you know that he is waiting for me?"

"We have an oracle," the Persian replied, "The Lord of the night spoke to us. He said that the sun would rise in the East, and the sun would illuminate the Carrhae."

"Quite a strange words for the Lord of the Night," I said, "Why does he need the sun?"

"There is no night without the sun. The Lord of the Night greets you as an equal."

It was either a flattery, or really the words of the oracle. I was leaning towards the latter.

Only I and the entity that was coming into my dreams knew about the secret play of the Moon and the Sun, about their impossible relationship. If she really was a Lunar deity, no matter what sex, she could have sent me an invitation through her priest. But in the same way, any small king could be welcomed in the East -- they do not skimp on molasses here.

I didn't betray my feelings. I have learned this perfectly in recent years.

"What does the Lord of the Night expect from me?"

"What do the gods usually expect from kings? A sacrifice worthy of the one who brings it."

I see, I thought. It will be necessary to give their temple a part of the Alexandrian trophies. But I didn't know all the details of local etiquette.

"What kind of sacrifice is usually offered to the Lord of the Night?"

"It depends on what is expected of him," the priest replied, "If great things are expected, then the sacrifice must be great…"

He rolled his eyes expressively.

"It can be a secret."

"A secret? From whom?"

"From everyone except God. When the rulers of Babylon came to our temple, they entered it with their trusted people and sealed the door from the inside."

"Are you talking about human sacrifice?" I frowned, "It doesn't befit a Roman emperor."

"A great sacrifice befits the Great Emperor," the priest replied with a bow, "I heard that the Emperor Hadrian sacrificed Antinous to prolong his days."

"Antinous drowned in the Nile."

The priest smiled.

"No one drowns in the Nile without a reason."

"It's gossip," I said, "I heard that Antinous sacrificed himself. Out of love for the emperor."

The priest bowed even lower.

"What our guests do while staying in the temple is known only to them and the god. Perhaps some of them sacrifice themselves out of love."

"But I don't want to kill anyone on my first visit to your god."

"That's not what I'm talking about," the priest replied, "I'm talking about the fact that there are no intermediaries between the guest of god and the god himself in our temple. They meet in person, and the mystery remains a secret."

"Tell me, can I talk to the deity?"

"You can," the priest nodded, "But that doesn't mean the deity will talk to you the way you talk to him."

"What do you mean?"

"When a deity appears before us, we are not able to see him in his full might. We think that this is a human. If the deity notices us, it seems to us that a human is talking to us, paying all his attention to the conversation. But for the deity, it's like holding an ant on the little finger of one of his countless hands and looking at it with one of his countless eyes. The human is never taken seriously by a deity. A human just deems so…"

I ordered to give him gold and sent him back to the temple, saying that I would come soon.

Sacrifice a human being? There is no difficulty here, either one or a legion, but does it please the Moon?

I took a potion that evokes vivid dreams, and I met her again. The moon appeared to me in the form of a young girl, similar to the one I slept with a week ago, wearing the usual mask for such cases. She, I mean the girl, was a local slave, thin and dark. The moon appeared to me the same way. She also wore a mask, and her eyes were laughing merrily from the slits of a mask.

We were standing in the garden on the flat roof of a Babylonian house; I knew it was Babylon by the blue glaze on the city wall.

The house had long been abandoned, but the garden fed by the aqueduct had not perished, but, on the contrary, had flourished and looked like a forest thicket raised to the top of a hill. I remember statues of bearded bulls, a large sundial still visible through the grass, and a swing covered with greenery.

The moon swung on them, and I played her pipes, in a dream I could do it very skillfully. She didn't make any effort: the swing was set in motion by the sound of my instrument. But blowing the pipe was exhausting. I reminded myself of a slave with a fan; the memory of how such slaves were used by matrons gave me a timid hope, but I was afraid that my hope, becoming noticeable, would offend the deity.

The Moon broke the silence.

"Tell me, Bassianus," she said, "what are you willing to pay for my love?"

She called me what no one dared, since I began to be called Aurelius Antoninus.

"With my love, my mistress," I found myself.

She laughed.

"Do you think this is enough?"

"I hope so. I understand that love of the mortal is shallow, but I have a whole sea of it."

She laughed again, and then became thoughtful, touching her forehead to the swing rope. I couldn't see her face, but her neck was tender and beautiful. The swing stopped. I no longer blew the pipe, waiting for her words.

"So who do you love more?" she asked, "Me or Artaban's daughter?"

She somehow knew about my matchmaking to the daughter of the Parthian king.

"I don't love Artaban's daughter at all, my mistress," I replied, "I asked for her hand in marriage, knowing that I would be rejected. I needed a reason for war…"

I fell silent, afraid that I had said too much.

There were rumors among the soldiers that the Lunar deity from Carrhae was protecting Parthia from Rome, and it was to this god that Crassus owed his death. I didn't believe it, knowing how far the gods are from earthly strife. Parthia, Rome -- what does the goddess care about them?

She nodded softly, as if she heard my thoughts and agreed with them.

"You look so touchingly for our meeting," she said at last, "as if you know how it will turn out."

"I know everything about love," I replied.

"Yes," she said, "But this is human love. You play it by putting masks on your girlfriends, and you think that you are approaching me in this way."

"I'm sorry, my mistress, if I offended you with my impatience."

"No, you didn't offend me. You amused me and touched me. But you should understand that divine love is of a completely different kind than human love. It may be too much for you..."

"My father wanted me to become a new Alexander," I replied, "And he, they say, was the son of Zeus. Love between a human and a deity can bear a child[TODO:archaic]. My people worship me like a god. I worship only you, my mistress... I am a slave who dreams of your smile."

She smiled.

"So be it. But remember, Bassianus, you don't know what you're looking for. So don't be surprised and don't grumble when you finally find it... and now swing me again."

I played the pipes.

"No," she said, "not like that. Not with a whiff. Swing me with the *light*."

Perplexity must have shown on my face, and she pointed to the overgrown sundial.

"You've done it before. You know."

I understood what she wanted. She called me to her -- and we really have done it before.

Dropping the pipe, I seemed to be inflamed with passion and became a radiance that cut through the night. While I was burning myself, the mistress was looking with interest at her shadow that appeared on the old wall. There was no such shadow before. I realized that I had given her pleasure. And then happiness swept over me, burning and squeezing me dry…

When it was over, the goddess became sad.
"You're nice to me," she said, "but you're not the Sun."

"And who is the Sun?"

"I'll find him myself. But I will take you with me, and you will be by my side forever…"

I guessed myself that I was not the Sun. I was only feasting with him at the same table. But now it didn't matter anymore. The goddess loved me. She was calling.

I gave the order to prepare a detachment of cavalry to leave Edessa for Carrhae. I'll dress inconspicuously, I thought, in caracalla. I should have brought more soldiers with me. The enemy was not around, and for the first time we meet, I was going to be with the goddess for a very short time, but the emperor should always remember about the wolf, which he holds by the ears…
