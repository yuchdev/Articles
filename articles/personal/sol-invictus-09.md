# Chapter 9
--

Of the gods, ancient and novel, I liked the shiny Mithra the most. My father and mother encouraged me in this from childhood, but in different ways.

It was all clear with my father. The Eastern god was held in high esteem by the soldiers, and it did not hurt for the future emperor to have tastes in common with them.

"Eat their food, worship their god, walk with them on the march," my father repeated, "and they will give their lives for you."

I remembered one of the Mithreums of Lugdunum, the city where I was born. Or rather, the view from this Mithreum: a clean, neat street, a fresh, clear sky and a pink sun hanging in front of the doors, trembling right over the flat cobblestones. The pavement ran up the hill, and the sun seemed to appear in the morning on the road leading to the sanctuary.

Mother knew a lot of strange things about the Sun. For example, she said that in fact the Sun is a conical black stone standing in the temple of the Syrian city of Emesa. It sounded so absurd and so contrary to common sense that I believed her. Moreover, others believed in it too, and their faith fed our family.

We are all looking for the miraculous to deceive the fate and go beyond the boundaries of the ordinary. Religion, which claims that the Sun is not a yellow circle in the sky, but a mysterious Stone hidden in a Syrian backwater, can captivate not only a child, but also a serious philosopher.

My mother Julia Domna came from an ancient family of priest-kings who served the Sun Stone and ruled Emesa. Her father Bassian was also a priest, but no longer a king. They say, he saw the future and created miracles. But in the East, this can hardly surprise anyone.

It was said about my mother Domna that in her youth, either by herself or at the request of my grandfather Bassian, she gathered the best philosophers and sophists of the Hellenic world at the main shrine of the Emesa's temple. They argued for hours in front of the Stone about the affairs of our life and the bitter human lot, so that the deity would know everything first-hand.

At the same time, a veil of the finest linen was thrown over the Stone, on which a large ear was embroidered in gold. The philosophers who bickered in front of the ear, Domna called "divine informers" and "spies of the Sun."

It's hard to believe that my grandfather could ask her for such a thing. On the other hand, it is even more difficult to admit that this could have happened in the temple without his knowledge.

In a word, the family was not without divine oddities, as befits the Princeps family. Caligula, after all, also talked to Jupiter, whispering to his statue – my relatives were just more respectful. They did not bother the deity with their requests, but delicately informed him about the state of affairs in the world.

The mother's family continued serving the Sun Stone, but the future emperor, my father said, this does not suit. It is more useful to worship Mithra together with the soldiers. He is also in some way the Sun and also in some way a Stone, because he was born from a rock.

My mother agreed with these clumsy soldier sophisms and did not initiate me too deeply into the Syrian mysteries. But even the little I heard from her was enough to impress my imagination forever.

The chosen one of the gods will come from our family. Am I not this man, I thought at night, remembering the Gallic Mithreum with the sun turning pink in the open doors…

When my father, having already become emperor, took the rebellious Lugdunum by storm, I did not find neither this Mithreum nor this sunny street. It is quite possible that I saw them in some other city during our endless travels. The Emperor of Rome is doomed to wander, and his family follows him.

The soldier's faith in Mithra suited me perfectly. It seemed much more understandable than the ancient cults of the Olympians and sophisticated Eastern heresies.

Mithra was born from a stone ("from the very same black Stone," the mother added in a whisper, "this is a poetic figure, we are talking about a symbolic birth"). Mithra, though he was not the Sun himself, but he feasted with him at the same table.

The soldier is as hard as a stone. A soldier, like Mithra, feasts at the same table with the Sun. Rather, it is the Sun in a purple cloak sits down by his campfire and eats his food. So did all the emperors who wanted to live for a long time.

I saw another Mithreum that I remember as a boy in the East. On the wall was the usual image of Mithra slaying a bull, and above it were round shields with the faces of the Moon and the Sun. The face of the Moon was so beautiful and tender that I asked to make me a copy of it on a gold medallion, and since then I have carried it with me.

I think that's when my great love was born.

I considered myself a little Sun, then a little Mithra, and often persuaded adults to let me slain the bull, as Mithra did. They laughed at me, but sometimes they let me. Little bullocks were singled out for my amusements, but in those days they seemed to me to be adult mighty bulls. Of course, others had to finish off the beast studded with my arrows.

At the age of thirteen, I managed to kill a bullock with a spear thrown from above. After I spent a few minutes over his carcass and touched his blood with my fingers, I lost my taste for this cruel fun. Although Mithra was killing bulls on innumerable frescoes, he was a good god. I also wanted to be a good god. Alas, my father explained to me early, this is not always possible in our world.

I was the son of a living Sun, a luminary with wrinkles, a graying dyed beard and coarse big hands. This Sun shone throughout the vast empire, warmed it and nourished it, and people came just to see him and bow to him. I could become the next Sun, but I had a brother – and there are no two suns in the sky.

Geta always seemed to me to be a fake god, placed by fate next to me in order to test and torment me, the real god.

He was ugly, overweight and sweaty, but he knew how to win over polite treatment and flattering speech. It affected people even more than my generosity. But I despised such tricks, and, looking at Geta, I seemed to turn away from his courteous pretense, acquiring a manner completely opposite: harsh and direct speech, understandable and close to the soldiers.

This was, of course, also the prudence. My father used to say that the emperor of Rome these days is anyone the legions will listen to. Any person, he repeated, jokingly covering his mouth with his palm, as if to conceal this terrible truth from the guests and guards.

Then, more seriously, he added that the imperium must have a divine right. But even a man with such a right will cease to be an emperor as soon as the soldiers get tired of listening to him. And this last truth he never tired of hammering into me.

Caligula grew up in a military camp and amused the soldiers with his soldier's shoes, but then he indulged in disastrous excesses of the capital. The emperor, my father said, should not stray too far from his legions. Even the divine Marcus Aurelius, the great sage, of whom my father spoke with admiration and envy, spent his life on campaigns, and created his philosophy among soldiers' tents.

The more I looked at these tough people, wrapped in leather and metal, the more I wanted to become one of them. This was a challenge to the pampered Geta, an attempt to resemble my father, and also the King Alexander, who made his great conquest five hundred years ago. Alexander, however, demanded divine honors and adopted Persian luxury. But you can be a modest Sun, I thought. Shine to the whole world and be content with wooden dishes. Marcus Aurelius was just like that.

My father was hated in Rome. They hate all the emperors there; our destiny is to wander around the outskirts of the empire at the head of huge armies and protect those who pray for our death from destruction. But the day will come when we won't be able to do it anymore. Babylon killed Alexander, Rome killed Caesar – what, I wonder, will kill me?

Britain killed my father.

Oh, this dim, treacherous island, the abode of ancient debauchery! The Caledonian adulteries so horrified my mother that she publicly reproached barbaric women for them. The wife of the Caledonian leader – or his mistress, there is no particular difference there, replied that they were only doing openly what Rome was secretly indulging in. In fact, of course, she was right.

My father fought all his life, first with the barbarians in the East, then with the rebels in Gaul. If the dice had fallen differently, he would have been called a rebel himself. Nowhere did he shed so much Roman blood as at Lugdunum, where he defeated Clodius Albius. But even after that, he was not destined to rest.

I remember his stories about the East, which seemed especially incredible amid the British rains. The war there took place over vast expanses; armies loitered for a long time in the desert in search of the enemy – in Britain they had to cut through the thickets. To push back the border of the empire by only a hundred miles, it was necessary to expend more effort than it took to conquer the whole eastern kingdom.

The legions were hardly fighting here. Instead, they were digging a huge ditch that cut the island from west to east, and erecting a fortified embankment next to it. Or rather, they were not even digging, but restoring what was dug half a century ago and almost absorbed by dampness and grass.

The moat was flooded with rain, the earth crumbled, logs slid off the embankment, but the legionnaires repaired it like ants an anthill. Seventy years ago, the soldiers of the happy age built a wall from one sea to another. It was lying in our rear, a hundred miles to the south. I was looking at Hadrian's Wall and thinking: how so? Everyone who built it is already dead... and we are raising a new wall – and that means we will also die soon! Is this really the fate of all people?

As a child, I imagined the war not like this. But my father said that even under Caesar, Rome defeated the Gauls not with a sword, but with a shovel, and this is the only type of military action that gives lasting results.

In the East, my father, as befitted a Roman Equestrian, rode before the legions on horseback. In Caledonia, he was carried in a palanquin, and he did not even look out of its windows. He wore a long beard to resemble Marcus Aurelius, and died just like him, in a military campaign, in a foreign land.

However, Marcus Aurelius was humble and peaceful, but my father, before his death, was going to exterminate all Caledonians along with unborn babies in their wombs, and had already given such orders. It was whispered that the Caledonians had tormented him with their witchcraft for this very reason (there were, however, rumors that Geta and I poisoned him – and I can't vouch for Geta).

Marcus Aurelius left behind voluminous notes. My father also had his own philosophy, but it would all fit on one tablet. He never bothered to write it down and stated it verbally before his death:

"Honor the gods, pay the soldiers, spit on everything else..."

When my father died, Geta and I took his body to Rome and the mechanics of the imperial cult began to move. I saw a custom in action that I didn't even know about.

A wax dummy was made by my father's image [TODO:archaic], almost indistinguishable from him (only its beard turned out to be too black, father painted his in a different shade). The dummy was pale, but an unhealthy consumptive blush was applied to its cheeks, which became brighter over time.

The dummy was officially sick.

It was lying on a high bed of ivory and gold under the open sky. Embroidered curtains was hiding it from people. Senators who had hated my father during his lifetime bowed before his likeness, and the wind blew their mourning robes. The noblest women of Rome, in all white, without a single piece of jewelry, were mournfully silent at the bed, about which they had been gossiping all their lives. The doctors examined the dummy with a serious look, and did the only thing they could do well: saying that there was no hope anymore.

Then the dummy was declared dead and carried along the sacred road to the old Forum. In the last days of father's life, he was carried around Caledonia in the same way.

I looked at the procession and thought: Roman people, here is an emperor worthy of you – a wax dummy. Deaf to your reproaches, indifferent to your praises, invulnerable to poisons and blades. I will become such a dummy in my lifetime – for everyone except those I love. Or I hate...

I loved the goddess of the Moon, and I hated my brother, with the same bitterness with which he hated me. Our mutual resentment seemed to me like a burning ray caught between two mirrors, it darted between us, unable to destroy either him or me.

The father's dummy was eventually brought to the Field of Mars and raised on a funeral pyre, arranged in the form of a wooden house with three floors. I thought that the fire was lit by our with Geta hatred – so fiercely and quickly it burned. When an eagle depicting our father's soul burst out of the smoke and flames and flew to the clouds, there was no power left on earth that could protect Geta and me from each other.

I killed Geta first. From the point of view of rhetoric, this phrase is ridiculous, you can only say "I killed Geta" – the murdered person cannot become a murderer. But in our case, it was just like that – I killed Geta first, and his hand, already raised above me with a knife, turned into ashes.

The Praetorians received me in their camp, and with them I returned to the city. Geta and I had previously divided the palace in half, and now all those who lived on his half and served him went after my brother. And then those who aspired to become his clients in Rome. This is what they do in those countries where Alexander came at the end of his campaign. A wise custom.

I had a dream about my father – or rather, his wax dummy, burned on the Field of Mars. The dummy said in my father's voice:

"Honor the gods. Pay the soldiers…"

It seemed that the father wanted to add something else, but he was hidden by the smoke from the many fires on which food was cooked. In a dream, such inconsistencies happen every now and then. The interpreter considered this sign favorable in the highest degree.

I didn't just raise the soldiers' pay, I became one of them. But about the gods…

When I became emperor, I began to look at them differently. There are many gods, especially in the East, and none of them can be offended. This is no longer religion, but politics already.

It was not quite clear to me which of them should be honored for good luck in business. After all, new gods are constantly appearing in the empire – and they go to Rome in the same way as rebel generals do at the head of their legions. The foretellers keep repeating that Rome will bow before the new deity. But how? When?

My Syrian relatives became priests of the Sun in infancy, and they did not have such questions. The Sun, just it is. Helios, the hidden Sol Invictus, the Syrian Elagabal, the Egyptian Ra – I have heard about them since childhood. I worshipped Mithra not from the dust, but almost as an equal: This is how the senator pays his respects to the Princeps. The sky above the image of Mithras was decorated with the Sun and Moon. The corner where the Sun shone was our family box.

But who was the beautiful creature from the opposite corner?

The Moon on the gold medallion, my secret, my love... I didn't even know what sex she was.

None of the people knew this: in one land she was Selena, in the other Lunus. When I was young, I looked for similar faces among slaves and peers , and anyone could become my temporary Moon. Even then I understood that I loved only the deity shining through them.

And this deity loved me too. Sometimes it descended into temporary forms that I found around, and gave me moments of joy. Phidias was creating gods out of marble; I carved them out of people. Unlike Caligula and Nero, I did not kill them after intercourse. There was no such need: the living vessels where the deity entered did not even know what was going on.

I believed that these substitutions would not always be my lot, and one day I would meet my fate face to face. I knew it would happen in the East. I couldn't remember where such confidence came from in my head: maybe it appeared after one of my father's stories, or I took it out of a dream.

In my dream, I met the Moon in a variety of places. Often there were sands or ruins lying around; the sky was sunless and dim, gray or even greenish in color (I once assumed that we were under water and around the remains of Atlantis described by Herodotus). But it was not an underwater world, but a sunless space of a bright night. Any hunter knows that the night is dark only for people.

The goddess wore a mask of the Moon. I was wearing a mask of the Sun, which I saw looking at my reflection in mirrors and puddles. I've seen these masks so often that I've even managed to draw them accurately.

My lunar girlfriend was beautiful and proved her divine nature by the fact that most often her sex could not be determined at first glance, but at the same time she did not look like a follower of Sappho, or a tinted boy offering his services in thermae. I say that I met with the Moon, but I also could say that I met with Lunus, I use the word "she" only out of habit of the mind.

Male or female is transparent and understandable, even when pretending to be its opposite. And the beauty that I saw was divine and incomprehensible. It was a mockery of human nature, split in two and mating to become one; what I met was already whole and did not need me as a half. It is impossible to express how it attracted and excited.

Usually we played games, the meaning of which I did not fully understand. I became like a slave serving a capricious and spoiled child.

We laid out strange objects in an empty courtyard or a hall. My movements between them were strictly regulated by rules understandable in a dream, but sometimes I managed to get very close to the deity and even touch her. And then my whole being was filled with unspeakable bliss.

I remember one dream especially well, where we collected a large sundial from colorful tiles. All the slots and protrusions had to match to make a drawn stone disk with numbers. What made this intricate puzzle even more difficult was that we had to stack the tiles one by one. While one of us was moving, the other was standing and waiting.

When the sundial was finally assembled, I noticed that instead of a shadow-casting prong, an ancient bronze sword was sticking out of the ground, pointing up.

I remember being fascinated by this detail in a dream, and I decided to immediately issue an edict ordering the same to be done with all the empire's sundial.

Thank God that this desire disappeared when I woke up. In a dream, such a substitution made sense; in reality, it did not. What else, I thought gloomily, and then replace the water in the clepsydra with blood in order to establish a balance between solar time and water time... Nero could've arranged this quite well, but me? Me?!
