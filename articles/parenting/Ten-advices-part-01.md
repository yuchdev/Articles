Advice 0. Advice about advises.<br>
- Accept advice not as an instruction to act, but as a source to think
- Always analyze advice credibility and source
- Be careful with advises given to you with the purpose to improve the wealth of the adviser
- Avoid complicated, ambiguous, confusing advises
- Responsibility for following or non following the advice is only yours, not the adviser
- Be aware that the so-called "Natural approach to baby care" comes not from Nature, but rather from the internet.

Advice 1. Have as much rest as you can afford. <br>
Accept any help. Accept kindness and greetings from your friends and your loving ones. 
Remember - the well-being of the mother is a pre-requisite of the baby's wellbeing as well.

Advice 2. Don't be afraid to ask.<br>
Don't be afraid to ask more experienced or more professional people, 
especially medical workers and baby-nurses.
* Create a list of questions you're going to ask. 
* Don't hope you remember them all.
* Such questions may relate to 
  * Baby's health
  * Contacting health professionals
  * Recommendations
  * Addresses and phones
  * Nursing recommendations
  * Clothes and hygiene
  * Walking and physical activities
  * Mother's health

Advice 3. Tuberculosis vaccine.<br>
Tuberculosis vaccine (or BCG vaccine) prevents the worst forms of tuberculosis and should be administered after baby birth, as soon as possible. Usually, the vaccine causes pain and leaves a small scar in the place of injection. In slightly heavier cases (which we encountered with our daughter), it causes local infection and forms a blister with pus. If it happens, don't panic,
you need to see a doctor and open it with a simple needle. The whole procedure does not bear any significant risk for a baby.

Advice 4. Do not compare.<br>
Don't compare your baby to adults or other babies. All babies are different, and babies are quite different than adults.
Don't rely on the opinion of your relatives, unless they are healthcare or baby care professionals. Otherwise, 
politely ask them to avoid comments.
Many things you considered bad because of superstitions and misinformation, is actually harmless or good, 
and vice versa.
There are two general tendencies among parents - one tends to consider "everything good with my baby", 
others look for all imperfections they can find.
Don't think your baby is too thin/thick, bald/hairy, quiet/noisy, pale/red.
Don't be fooled by unnecessary emotions. Mothers tend to be under hormonal impact right after giving  
birth  and during nursing

Advice 5. Right care of umbilical cord.<br>
It assumes usage of baby soap, clean water and cotton disk 1-2 times/day. 
Sometimes advise light iodine solution, it is up to you whether to use it.
Be careful with tap water, in many places its quality is far from desirable.
Try to create a situation when the umbilical cord has access to fresh air as much as possible.
Don't cover it with a bandage, patch, or diaper.
Remember, the umbilical cord should fall off without your enforcement, don't pull it. 
Exactly such non-interference contributes to the fact that the umbilical wound would heal quickly 
and without scars.

Advice 6. Compare advantages of breastfeeding and formula.<br>
Both breastfeeding and formula are totally valid choices, and it's only up to the parents to decide how to feed the baby, so opinions of relatives, friends and the internet could be politely ignored.
- Always the right temperature
- Always clean product
- Doesn't cost money to a family
- Time economy - faster than mix, heat, cool
- Food is always with you
- Milk components evolve over time
- Rarely develop diabetes, atherosclerosis, otitis, leucosis, psychic disorders
  Advantages of formula
- Breastfeeding could not be possible for a number of reasons: pain, breast infection, low supplies, or just the necessity to work and support the baby, if you're a single mom. The formula gives freedom to a mom, when she needs it.
- It has a balanced amount of protein, fat, and carbohydrates,
- You always know the exact amount of calories baby's getting
- It allows mom to share duties with dad, grandparents, or other relatives. It could release the time to bond with your baby
- Mom does not have to follow a strict diet, and may let herself a glass of wine on the baby's birthday.

Advice 7. Sleep position.<br>
The most comfortable and safest sleeping position for a baby is on the back. There are different opinions on whether the baby should sleep on her side or not - we can say, it's safe to experiment with such positions occasionally, but the back should remain the main position. Some babies prefer to sleep on her side - 
in this case, you need to overcome this habit and make her sleep on her back most of the time.

Advice 8. Advice to a daddy. <br>
It's extremely important for the father to be beside his loving ones, show care and support. 
Mother almost always suffers from lack of sleep, stress, fears, and as a result, decreases the ability of rational thinking. In such a situation, any support from you is valuable. Avoid stereotypical thinking 
"it's a women's job" - any care about your baby is a real man's job!

Advice 9. Advise to mommy. <br>
Father often tends to pass initiative about any baby problems to mom. He's afraid to do something wrong, 
to hurt or startle the baby, and most of all, afraid of negative judgment from mommy (even her knowledge 
is the same level as daddy's).
You should encourage any contact of the father and baby, show the daddy how hos opinion is important, 
discuss to him any questions related to the baby, and encourage him to enrich his knowledge about baby care.

Advice 10. Nursery room.<br> 
Any room with enough daylight, minimum dust, fresh air with control of
optimal temperature and humidity. For the first 6 months, the ideal nursery is the parent's bedroom. 
A separate nursery room is not necessary and not optimal if you need to reach your baby often. 
The best solution is a crib attached to the parent's bed. Sleeping in one bed with parents is not advised, 
as it carries a number of risks to the baby's health and affects the sleep of parents.
