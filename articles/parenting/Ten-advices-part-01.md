Advice 0. Advice about advises.<br><br>
- Accept advice not as instruction to act, but as a source to think
- Always analyze advise credibility and source
- Be careful with advises, designed to improve the wealth of the adviser
- Avoid complicated, ambiguous, confusing advises
- Responsibility for following or non following the advice is only yours, not the adviser
- Be aware that so-called "Natural approach to baby care" comes not from the Nature, but rather from the internet.

Advice 1. Have as much rest as you can afford. <br>
Accept any help. Accept kindness and greetings from your friends and your loving one. 
Remember - well-being of mother is a pre-requisute of baby's wellbeing as well.

Advice 2. Don't afraid to ask.<br>
Don't afraid to ask more experienced of more professional people, 
especially medical workers and baby nurses.
* Create a list of questions you're going to ask. 
* Don't hope you remember them all.
* Such questions may relate to 
  * Baby's health
  * Contacting health professionals
  * Recommendations
  * Addresses and phones
  * Nursing recommendations
  * Clothes and hygiene
  * Walking and physical activities
  * Mother's health

Advise 3. Tuberculosis vaccine.<br>
Tuberculosis vaccine (or BCG vaccine) prevents from the worst forms of tuberculosis, 
and should be administered after baby birth, as soon as possible. Usually vaccine causes pain 
and leaves small scar in the place of injection. In slightly heavier cases (which we encountered 
with our daughter), it causes local infection and forms a blister with pus. If it happens, don't panic,
you need to see a doctor and open it with a simple needle. The whole procedure does not bear 
any significant risk for a baby.

Advise 4. Do not compare.<br>
Don't compare your baby to adults or other babies. All babies are different, and babies are quite different
than adults.
Don't rely on opinion of your relatives, unless they are healthcare or baby care professionals. Otherwise, 
politely ask them to avoid comments.
Many things you considered bad because of superstitions and misinformation, is actually harmless or good, 
and vice versa.
There are two general tendencies among parents - one tend to consider "everything good with my baby", 
others look for all imperfections they can find.
Don't think your baby is too thin/thic, bald/hairy, quiet/nousy, pale/red.
Don't be fooled by unnecessary emotions. Mothers tend to be under hormonal impact right after giving  
birth  and during nursing

Advise 5. Right care of umbilical cord.<br>
It assumes usage of baby soap, clean water and cotton disk 1-2 times/day. 
Sometimes advise light iodine solution, it is up to you whether to use it.
Be careful with tap water, in many places it's quality is far from desirable.
Try to create situation when umbilical cord has access to fresh air as much as possible.
Don't cover it with bandage, patch or diaper.
Remember, umbilical cord should fall off without your enforcement, don't pull it. 
Exactly such non-interference contributes to the fact that the umbilical wound would heal quickly 
and without scars.

Advise 6. Compare advantages of breastfeeding and formula.<br>
Both breasfeeding and formula are totally valid choices, and it's only up to the parents to decide how to feed the baby, so opinions of relatives, friends and internet could be politely ignored.
- Always right temperature
- Always clean product
- Doesn't cost money to a family
- Time economy - faster than mix, heat, cool
- Food is always with you
- Milk components evolve over time
- Rarely develop diabetes, atherosclerosis, otitis, leucosis, psychic disorders
  Advantages of formula
- Breastfeeding could not be possible for a number of reasons: pain, breast infection, low supplies or just neccesity to work and support the baby, if you're a single mom. Formula gives freedom to a mom, when she needs it.
- It has balanced amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates,
- You always know exact amount of calories baby's getting
- It allows mom to share duties with dad, grandparents, or other relatives. It could release the time to bond with your baby
- Mom does not have to follow strict diet, and may let herself a glass of wine on baby's monthsarry

Advise 7. Sleep position.<br>
The most comfortable and safest sleeping position for a baby is on the back. There are different opinions 
whether baby should sleep on her side or not - we can say, it's safe to experiment with such positions 
occasionally, but the back should remain the main position. Some babies prefer to sleep on her side - 
in this case, you need to overcome this habit and make her sleep on her back most of the time.

Advise 8. Advise to daddy. <br>
It's extremely important for the father to be beside his loving ones, show care and support. 
Mother almost always suffers of lack of sleep, stress, fears, and as a result, decrease the ability 
of rational thinking. In such situation, any support from you is valuable. Avoid stereotypical thinking 
"it's a women's job" - any care about your baby is a real man's job!

Advise 9. Advise to mommy. <br>
Father often tends to pass initiative about any baby problems to mom. He's afraid to do something wrong, 
to hurt or startle the baby, and most of all, afraid of negative judgment from mommy (even her knowledge 
is the same level as daddy's).
You should encourage any contact of the father and baby, show the daddy how hos opinion is important, 
discuss to him any questions related to the baby, and encourage him to enrich his knowledge about baby care.

Advise 10. Nursery room.<br> 
Any room with enough daylight, minimum dust, fresh air with control of
optimal temperature and humidity. For the first 6 months ideal nursery is parent's bedroom. 
Separate nursery room is not necessary and not optimal, if you need to reach your baby often. 
The best solution is a crib attached to parent's bed. Sleeping in one bed with parents is not advidsed, 
as it carries a number of risks to baby's health and affect sleep of parents.
