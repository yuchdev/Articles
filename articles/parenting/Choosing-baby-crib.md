## Choosing the crib: video script

#### Intro
Designing a nursery could be fun and exciting. 
It is designed not just to create a nice place for your baby to grow, learn and develop, but to give him or her a sense of comfort and safety. Giving these good intentions, choosing the right crib for your baby is one of the most important decisions in your design process - after all, your baby is going to spend there approximately 2-3 years of their lives.
Also, a newborn baby sleeps most of the day, so the crib becomes literally a first living habitat for a baby.

You probably suspect you have to consider a number of factors, but you can't imagine even one yet, especially if it's your first baby. To help you save time, we're as experienced parents can share our research on this problem as well as our experience.

#### Safety precautions
First of all, you should consider baby safety as your main priority. Cribs are designed not just to provide a place for an infant to sleep, but as a tool to keep him or her in place (my first cage!).
Make sure that crib material is safe for a baby. Crib bars should not be wider than 20cm, preventing the baby from getting stuck behind them while trying to escape. The crib corner post should not be significantly higher than the barrier, not to catch baby clothes. There should not be toys inside, make your kid get used to a fact that a crib is a place for sleep, not for play. Avoid placing the crib beside windows, electric outlets, wires and cords, curtains and doors.
Babies are sensitive to dust and easily could be allergic while you don't know it yet, you should vacuum the mattress and wash the beddings often to keep your baby safe.

#### Expected lifespan
How long you should expect the crib to serve you and your baby? Consider 24-36 months a good investment. For this reason, look for cribs with a good *extended margin* in size and quality. Depend on your situation, you may consider options like an expanding crib, and crib with one or more safety bars removable.

#### Crib types
* Standard crib. Traditional, full-size cribs, serving as the first bed for your baby. Take into consideration that such cribs are cot convertible and not portable at all, you should buy them if you are sure you don't move anywhere and you have plenty of room in your nursery. It is usually the cheapest type of crib, but it doesn't mean it's easy to buy - it literally could be hard to find them on the market, because most parents want the crib to be "more than just a crib", or it's just market is telling them what to do.
They may quite vary in design, having a lightweight minimalistic frame or a bulky one with arches and curves, having wheels or not, using wood, metal or acryl as a material.
* Convertible crib. Convertibles may grow with your baby and are sometimes called a "lifetime crib". Even though it could be an exaggregation, some models are really capable to transform into a full-size bed and may serve you and your child for many years, up to the teenage period. It may have up to 3 configurations, related to your child's age - configuration for infant, toddler, and primary school age. They could be a good solution for parents who aren
* Combo. Combo cribs usually play space- and money-saving role in your nursery, because they feature a foldable changing table, and sometimes a drawer and shelves, which is usually cheaper than buying them separately. Its downside could be low mobility, it's hard to disassemble them to transport them to a new place, and they are rarely convertible into a bed for toddlers or preschool-age kids.
* Bassinets. It is a mobile and flexible solution, designed for the first months of your baby's life. It is ideal to keep your eye on the baby while you are busy elsewhere because the bassinet is designed to be easily transportable without even disturbing the baby. Due to its compact size, the bassinet could be an ideal solution for lofts and studios, which could be a financial constraint for young parents. As usual, its convenient properties are the downsides at the same time - bassinets have a very limited lifespan, and choosing a bassinet for your baby, keep in mind what would be the next solution for your precious child's sleep.
* Portable or folding crib. It may fit you and your baby if you're expecting to travel a lot for the first 2 years of your baby's life (which is quite a challenge for everyone in the family!), or you expect to leave your baby in grandparents or summer house (joke about leaving the baby to parents). It could be foldable or easily disassemblable, which is a little less convenient. Such cribs could be folded or disassembled in a timeframe of 1-10 minutes, they don't take much space and you can fit them into a travel case or backpack. They usually have wheels to position it conveniently in the new place, and some of them may also play as a playard (so-called Pack-n-Play cribs). Some more expensive models may include a portable changing table, baby mobiles, and additional storage pockets.

#### Cribs on wheels
Most modern cribs are equipped with wheels or have them as an additional option. This is an extremely valuable achievement of baby's furniture design, as the collective experience tells you that you may need to re-arrange the furniture in the nursery multiple times. Some cheapest classic cribs may not have wheels though, choosing such a budget option, make sure you get what you expected to.

#### Rocking or swinging cribs
A positive effect of swinging motion, calming and relaxing sleeping baby is known to everyone, that's why literally every crib includes some sort of rocking or swinging component in its design, and their convenience may vary depending on your needs.
* Classic rocking cradle, featuring a curved foundation, which rocks right and left using the weight of the cradle itself. In our opinion, it is not the very optimal solution - first, it could be not safe, while applying excessive force it could flip over, injuring the baby. Also, it faces a strong frictional force, depending on the material covering the floor, which is harder on carpets and rugs.
* Swinging cradle designed by the principle of a pendulum. This sort of bed features a stationary four-legged structure as a foundation, and the baby's crib is being hung on two vertical pillars in the head and feet of the crib, but sometimes it is supported by a horizontal bar along with the crib. Such design significantly decreases the resistance of friction, and is way safer for the baby. Modern models may include some automated swinging solution, getting you out of a monotonous job of a manual swinging - be careful with such a solution, we will talk about it soon.
* The crib with a stationary foundation with a rectangular frame, featuring miniature pendulums on all 4 legs for swinging left and right. The whole crib is hanged on that foundation several centimeters above the floor. The solution is very safe, flexible and convenient, and usually could be found in convertible cribs. When your baby doesn't need swinging, you just remove the foundation and put 4 legs on the floor.

#### Crib with electric swinging
Pendulum-like cribs could be powered with an electric motor, releasing you from the tiring and monotonous manual swinging. While the idea is good in general, it has lots of tricky details. First, make sure the sound of a motor of moving parts of the crib is not loud or annoying, because it absolutely could be. And even though most babies are proven to fall asleep even in such harsh conditions, parents usually are less lucky. Another devil in details could be in the amplitude of singing, because if it's too small, swinging is turned into shaking, which often has an effect opposite to swinging, causing headache and nausea, and even injure the baby's brain (see shaken baby syndrome). Make sure you tested swing automation before choosing the crib, and don't use cheaper models, which are prone to fast wearing out f mechanical parts. 
And of course, keep in mind safety considerations: such automated solutions are powered by electricity, which is clearly a hazardous factor for a baby. Be also aware, that such a crib with a constantly working swing motor may cause a baby's dependency on swinging motion, and it will become extremely hard to put the baby asleep without it.

#### Removable safety railguards and co-sleeping cots
Some mothers consider sleeping with the newborn baby in one bed, to be closer to the child, monitor his needs, and make him feel loved from the very first day of his life. Such a solution could be temporary by definition, and sooner or later they face the necessity to put the baby to sleep alone. In such a process a bed called a co-sleeping cot could be an extremely valuable transition tool - you just remove one of the safety bars, pull sideways or lower as a flap, if the side is made of fabric-like material. Obviously, such a cot should be portable enough to be placed beside the parent's bed, and being firmly fixated in its place, because it tends to slip away from the parent's bed, and the baby may fall. However, taking all necessary precautions the solution could be safe and convenient, and some mothers may experiment with gradually raising the bar between their and baby's beds.
