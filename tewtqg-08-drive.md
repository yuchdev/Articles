Drive 
The most efficient data privacy solution is still an old-school external encrypted hard drive, probably having multiple backups in different locations. However, people still need cloud storage, and probably need it for a reason. Bringing all data with you might be not very convenient and dangerous - there’s always a probability of losing both data and the key. Here we have to trust the security of our data to cloud providers, and picking one could be quite a challenge. As usual, we prefer maximum security, privacy, and transparency of user agreement, open-source solutions to be sure the service code could undergo an audit by security experts. Of course, such general properties like service reliability, and reasonable price of your storage play their role as well. Cloud providers should have 2FA not relying on Google, and do not rely on Google in general. This is the reason why we do not consider Dropbox as an option because it is connected to Google for the sign-in process. If you forbid executing 3rd-party scripts, you won’t be able to log in on your personal profile. 
As usual, we do not consider self-hosted storage here, giving them a separate review. 

pCloud. One more affordable privacy-oriented provider from Switzerland. It offers two levels of protection, your general-purpose storage, and an encrypted folder inside it. You might put all your files inside it right away, to ensure the maximum level of security. pCloud offers an interesting pricing option, granting lifetime access for a single payment (information as per May 2021). However, as the practice has shown, a lifetime subscription tends to outlive its service.  
pCloud has a mobile application with automated photos upload (a feature that is buggy at least on Android). 
Service offers little to nothing collaboration tools, except simple file sharing, make sure you don’t need them on a daily basis by choosing this provider. 

Mega. New Zealand-based company position itself as one of the most security- and privacy-oriented cloud providers. Mega provides desktop or mobile clients which perform file encryption even before being uploaded to the cloud storage. The mega client is open source and popular enough, so you can make sure quite a lot of security experts perform a regular service audit for vulnerabilities. 
Security features of the service are pretty much head-to-head with pCloud, and it’s hard to say clearly, which one is better. Both pCloud and MEGA offer zero-knowledge encryption to keep your data secure, both are fairly easy to use.
pCloud offers a bit more convenient synchronization features.
Mega offers an option of backing up your recovery key, contrary to the standard password recovery procedure. In case you forgot your password - so if you lost both your password and key, there’s no way to access your data. 
However, Mega offers more flexible and detailed plans, the most advanced of which offers up to 16TB of drive space (as of May 2021), so if you have lots of data to store in your cloud, Mega would be your favorite.
Sync. Company based in Canada, however, UK GDPR compliance is applied to the service. Service is pretty much head-to-head with pCloud, even pricing for standard 2TB plans is the same. I would say, the distinctive pro feature is a user collaboration tool and plan for teams, and contra, which appeared critical for me, is very limited mobile application functionality (mobile apps is in general "Achilles heel" of cloud services). However, it may be not that critical for everyone to give the service a try. 

Protondrive. We already familiar with the perfect family of services developed by CERN – Protonmail, Proton Calendar, and Proton VPN, and a private secure cloud storage service would be a logical addition to the Proton encrypted ecosystem. ProtonDrive is available to users, who already have a Protonmail account. Proton is a fairly new service, and little known about it, however, in additions to all standard features we expect from secure cloud storage, ProtonDrive features active protection against hacker attacks, advanced data storing model - every user has its own virtual drive called volume, and piece of information serving as a key, called share, the share encrypted with the asymmetric key, and a passphrase. Encryption/decryption steps are being repeated on every level of the virtual filesystem hierarchy.
Like many similar services, ProtonDrive offers a feature of sharing files or directories. Shared content is protected by a unique URL and a password.
The only possible downside of such a secure service is not surprisingly, its age. It was recently released after beta testing, and many especially cautious users from the privacy community advised to wait 6-12 months until service would become more mature, and initial bugs would be fixed. Whether you support their concerns or not, ProtonDrive is going to be a solid player in the cloud storage market.
