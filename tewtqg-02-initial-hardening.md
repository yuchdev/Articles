## Initial Account Hardening

The decision to start a new life without Google services usually does not come at once, plan how to implement it would take some time, and if you manage to do all data and accounts migration just in one year or less, you can consider yourself very fast.
The first countermeasure would be your acceptance. The damage is done, and (probably) most of your personality, your wife, kids and dogs have records in Google ad preferences. However, you can at least stop it, right now. You can stop it without quit using Google Mail with 10 GB of data, Google Docs with recipes of your grandma and Google Photos with your home video. However, if I were you, I’d have removed THAT video, right away. Kids still may be smarter than you expected, you know.
Yeah, the good news is on the way – countermeasures could (and must!) be taken right away, before even starting any migration. I’m talking about opting out of collecting your user data: geolocation, search history, sharing information, etc. Even if it claimed to be used for “improving the relevance of advertisements”, I hardly believe so, especially important things like where was I on the first Saturday of May 10 years ago. 

### Geolocation services 
You have a right to opt-out of your location collection, and you can delete existing stored data: 
![Delete location history]()
Delete all timeline history 
www.google.com/maps/timeline  

 

Pause all location collection 
https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols/location  

 
There’s probability, it will decrease appetite of the behemoth to collect your location of information. Why probability? Google sued for tracking people after opting out. Yes, they even resort to such unethical and predatory practices. However, in this case you can’t do much, unless you are Cyber Security professional. The only relief is increasing trend on privacy awareness and existence of whistleblowers, capable of revealing such unethical practice, which leaves us descent amount of hope.

Search history and ad personalization 
https://myactivity.google.com/privacyadvisor/search
You can turn off collecting of your web activity, voice and audio recordings, information about installed applications and contact info. However, if you find some setting particularly useful and/or not harmful for your privacy, you can leave it on – it’s all up to you. I left YouTube history because I often come back to interesting educational videos I did not have time to finish.
Surprisingly, your search activity contains not just only history of your Google queries, but links you typed and clicked, and the location where you did it. Choose “Delete all Search activity”.
 

Pause your Google-wide control under app activity. Following by link See all Activity Controls you also can manage YouTube history, People&Sharing, and your data in Google Assistant. Pause “Web&App activity”, pause “Voice and audio recordings” and “Contact info from your devices”. You may leave “App info from your devices”, these settings just manage information about installing apps.
 

Turn off your ads personalization. Select Paused.
 

Other services
https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup
Do the final checkup of your privacy settings. I’m sure, you can find plenty of privacy settings you did not spot anywhere else. Choose “About you” section, and turn off displaying information about you and “endorsing” you in Google Maps. Choose the “Phone Numbers” section and forbid “helping people” to identify you by your phone number. In “Google Photo Settings” you can turn off automated recognizing your face, this feature is used for creating connections between you and people who uploaded your photos. Also, here you should turn on “Remove geolocation in items shared by link”, which records your position with precision up to meters while sharing stuff.

 

Ads personalization on Android
Go to your phone Settings (Gear button) -> Google -> Ads, and select “Opt out of Ads Personalization” and perform “Reset advertising ID” 

 

Google Assistant on Android
Google Assistant is a privacy disaster, and most people don’t even comprehend its magnitude. Imagine a total stranger, who listen what you and your family said, in any moment, all the time. And that stranger is not one person, it could be anyone who can access the voice device. Thanks to “closed source” model of Google’s applications, we can’t know for sure, what do they do with this information. And of course, all your Android devices have this feature enabled by default. We can fix it, even location of these settings is a bit hidden.
Depending on Android version and model, these settings could be located in slightly different places. For newer Android versions 9+, it is located in Settings-Google-Account Services (so it’s more Google account settings, than your phone) - Search, Assistant & Voice – Google Assistant.
Choose “Voice Match”, and toggle off “Hey Google” switch. Then select “Your data in the Assistant”, and make sure all settings are set on “Paused” - for me it is “Web & App Activity”, “Audio recordings”, “App info from your devices”, “Contact info from your devices”, and “Ad personalization”. Also, here you can delete all previous activity, choosing “Web & App Activity -> See & delete activity”, and “Audio recordings -> Listen & delete activity”.

Assistant activity while using headphones should be switched off separately (like if user turned it off globally, he still wants to say “Hey Google” in his headset). Depending on Android version and model, these settings could be located in slightly different places. For newer Android versions 9+, it is located in Settings-Google-Account Services (so it’s more Google account settings, than your phone) -> Search, Assistant & Voice -> Voice -> Hands-free, and toggle off switch “Bluetooth audio recording”. Somewhere there should be also switch for your connected hands-free device – turn off the switch “Get help from Google”
 
Google permissions on Android
After that, you can revoke Google application permissions. Go to Settings -> Apps -> Google -> Permissions, and toggle off all switches. Remember - if you do a factory reset an Android, you may need to go through this process again.
 
More detailed information about collected data could be found in the Google Privacy Policy Guide. However, read it like any document, created by a layer, which is not paid by you.
