The Easy Way to Quit Google. Intro
Brief intro into Empire of Good

It was said that you would destroy them! 
Not join them!
Obi-Wan

When Google declared its now-infamous code of conduct “Don’t Be Evil” in the early 2000s, it seemed to be quite a dare towards the “big corporate” world, which was represented by Oracle, Yahoo, and of course, the evil of evils, Microsoft. Two decades ago, this mantra was relegated into some sort of evil mockery.
During these two decades, many years and CEOs passed, and Google became pretty much embedded in our lives – web search and maps, mail and calendar, storage and photos, contacts and documents.
Honestly, I would have a pleasure to listen if someone would try to prove our “Empire of Good” not being currently the same kind of “Big Corporate”, as MS/Amazon/Oracle/Facebook, and arguably, much bigger evil than its competitors, which it claimed to oppose two decades ago.

Why should I quit, when all my cat memes are on Google Drive?
Run you fools!

You should decide for yourself, assuming you’re an adult person with computer literacy. I just let you know about a balance between your rights and your provider’s terms. On a perfectly legal basis, Google collecting and aggregating data of different layers of privacy about Internet users through a variety of tools, like Google Analytics, Google Play, Google Font, and different APIs. Most of the content you created and saved – your documents, spreadsheets, and photos can be accessed, modified and redistributed according to the Terms of Service (TOS). Gmail messages content is being read by Google algorithms, as they claim, only to improve the relevance of advertisements and block spam emails. Google places cross-site Cookies on each user's computer, including Ubercookies, which could not be cleaned. They create a unique ID of any device, accessing their services, and connect it to the user. These techniques are used to track a person's web browsing on a large number of unrelated websites and collect information about all browsers, applications, and devices related to the user. Not to mention CIA and NSA ties, lack of transparency, leading to data leakage, as well as Google Chrome and Google Android, surpasses any malware by amounts of personal data they know about you without catching your attention.
Google positions itself like an American company, supporting American values of freedom and equality, maybe that’s why it is expected to be “equal” for all users, by definition, you know. However, “some users are more equal than others”, especially when it comes to entering or staying on multi-million user markets. Google has been caught cooperating with totalitarian regimes, like Russia and China. They agreed to move users’ personal data to a physical location in Moscow, a big surprise for all users, who felt safe using American internet service. Also, Google has been spotted creating a censorship engine for the Chinese internet monitoring agency, in exchange for a promise to be allowed on a Chinese market again.
Above that, YouTube is broadly censoring internet-slang, referring to Chinese government-backed troll factory workers, 五毛, (wumao),” which roughly translates to "50-cent party", a derogatory term, aimed at online censors whom the Chinese government pays to direct conversations away from criticism of the ruling party, and its Russian analog, “ватник”, (vatnik), which denotes a steadfast jingoistic follower of Kremlin propaganda. . Not to say about multiple occasions of “pleasing” totalitarian authorities by removing accounts of civil rights activists using fabricated “TOS violations”.
Speaking about TOS, if Google was a modern startup, its customer support model would have destroyed its reputation pretty fast, because according to their agreement they require quite a lot from you, not offering any close to decent user support service.
Everyone who had a “good luck” of writing to their support, knows that the correct question about expecting an answer is “how often” rather than “how long”, and solving of your problem is not guaranteed of course. Problems of plebs should not bother patricians. In the article of Kyle Piira, he described his personal Google “user experience”, receiving a “letter of happiness” from Google about suspending his account, and that’s all. No prior warnings. No appeal process. No numbers to call. Don’t appear one day that person who would receive a “letter of happiness”.

How it works in two and a half words

Just because you're paranoid 
doesn't mean they aren't after you
Joseph Heller

I personally was a loyal user of Google for many years, being happy of increasing the usability of their services – it’s so handy to have your history and bookmarks on all desktops and smartphones, synchronize your phone contacts and use voice for hands-free search during driving or walking.
My eye-opener was a privacy startup where I started working 5 years ago, where I started being interested in things my service providers, including Google, know about me and my family. And I would say, it knows awfully a lot. All your search queries, typed URLs, clicked URLs, YouTube videos you watched, your bookmarks, history, accounts (with passwords), voice commands, your face on your friend’s photos. Even in the so-called “Incognito Mode” Google Chrome still uses your credentials and keeps your collecting your data, as was discovered by a security research group from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, US, largely misleading uninformed users. If you accidentally did not provide personal information about your age, gender, it could be deducted with pretty high accuracy, alongside your professional interests, TV show preferences, political views and medical history. It works not only for your personality, but also your nearest circle – family, friends, colleagues, and former classmates. People love using Google Assistant for silly jokes and puns. Try to ask her who are your wife and kids, what’s their preferences, and why does she think so – and maybe you won’t be laughing anymore.
From the article of Kashmir Hill “Goodbye Big Five”:
Privacy critics decried Google’s insatiable appetite for data, from capturing location information in unexpected ways - a practice Google changed when exposed, to capturing credit card transactions - a practice Google has not changed and actually seems proud of.
If Google can’t acquire data directly from their application, they will absolutely try to force you to use their search engine from other applications. Reportedly, Google pays $300 million to Mozilla Foundation, and $9 billion to Apple to set default search engine to Google.com, on Firefox and Safari respectively.
It is all required to create a “suggest matrix”, adjusting ads based on your gender, age, interest and social status. Why it’s important? According to public reports, up to 80% of sales made by online retailer giants like Amazon or Aliexpress performed using suggest algorithms. You do not actually look for these things to buy, it is suggested to you, and you can’t resist, because, well, they offer pretty necessary goods – because they know your taste, your favorite food, your wife’s birthday (buy her perfume), how old your kids (buy them school stuff). And yet, after they suggested everything, they still know what a person of your age and social status like with a certain probability. Meanwhile, while one human is not a very predictable creature, human groups are pretty much predictable, and consequently, controllable – all thanks to big numbers and probability.
It still might seem not so alarming, after all, everyone wants to sell stuff. Ales, people tend to think “it may happen to anyone but me” about anything, including death. Think about quite real examples, how such information could be used for much more harmful purposes like public (and personally yours!) opinion manipulation, spreading misinformation for reaching political and social goals on a nation-scale crowd – like meddling US presidential elections. As you may know, exactly this kind of service has been provided by the infamous Cambridge Analytica internet agency. 
Imagine, such a “Christmas come early” event would happen in unethical hackers and scammers community, if even part of user’s private data would leak. Do you think your insurance cover that?

Isn’t it enough? Google can be terrible beyond imagination
No way it would happen to me!
Standard last words

Google has actual CIA staff working for the company. Really, Some Google teams (e.g. Google Maps) include CIA personnel. Not all of them are involved in spying on you, Google is a nationally strategic company, and almost always under attacks from Russia and China. Just be aware of such employees exist.
People who get scammed or get malware from Google Ads don't realize a Google Ad was involved. They think they got "hacked" or did something wrong.
But probably the most notorious abuse of Google’s power is rampant blocking user’s accounts and deplatforming businesses, including Drive with valuable information, Google Play with the only way to distribute Android applications, Mail with thousands of emails and contacts. Users rarely do backups in general, they almost never backup cloud accounts, believing that their information is in reliable hands. The following article explains how does it feel to be locked out of Google:
Google had determined he had broken their terms of service, though they didn't explain exactly what had happened, and his account wouldn't be reinstated.
"I've been using a Google account for personal and work purposes for years now. It had loads of various types of data in there," said Stephen Roughley, a software developer from Birkenhead, UK. Roughley lost data including emails, photos, documents and diagrams that he had developed for his work.
"A fair amount of software licenses get delivered by email, especially audio software which is expensive," he said. "I have products from over two dozen different companies so it's probable I've lost a fair amount of those, given I also have no access to the email they were registered with." Then there are other services he's lost access to. Cleroth logged into many apps and services using his Google account, which he doesn't have access to anymore. "They're paid, I'll have to buy them again”
The developer feels betrayed by the company for shutting off access to vast swathes of his digital life in an instant, with little logical recourse. "It feels like getting baited by all the convenience that Google offers, only for Google to use your data as it pleases and possibly takes it all away with no prior notice"
The situation may become even grimmer, if you build your business model around Google. You can replace user-oriented cloud services, the whole series of articles is going to be about it. However, there are markets, where Google is a clear monopolist, despite of developed antitrust legislation in the US. If the small business relies on Google Ads or YouTube, there’s no way to replace it with a more reliable service. You should accept you can lose everything, any moment. And such stories are not something outstanding, there are regularly desperate threads like this on HackerNews:
I started a side business with some friends during the lockdown. We created an online store selling some hard-to-get long-tail items, and almost instantly got some traction and growth thanks to Google Shopping. A month ago, we received one of these generic automated mails that our account is banned and we were misrepresenting ourselves or a product with no details on what we did wrong. We went through the T&C's in some detail and we think we did everything they asked, and we have no idea what we didn't do well enough. We also checked in with every single client and we had near perfect scores on trust pilot, I can't recall a single incident with a client.
We've been contacting Google almost daily but almost never been able to find a human to talk to. Through unofficial channels we've found a few people in Google but whenever they gave us any advice on what to do it's always "off the record" or "you didn't hear it from me".
And it’s not just lost data, which you can recover from backup. It’s people losing their businesses and their jobs amidst pandemic, people with families to feed - without a chance to recover, with no one to appeal, and no hope for justice.
However, even if you had an explanation for why your account had been blocked, there’s no guarantee it will be a sane explanation.
There are many examples: reselling Pixel phones, writing too many emojis in YouTube chat, publishing "repetitive content" in the Play Store, not logging in for 60 days, or by pure accident. If you search on DuckDuckGo, I'm sure you can find many other examples.
Did the previous examples break the ToS? Some yes, some not. But the current ToS is 15 pages long and it changed 3 times in the last 4 years. And that's just a general ToS, Play Store has a separate ToS and YouTube as well. On top of this, they are quite vaguely formulated and many bans are unclear about the exact reason for which they have been instated.
