General choice of alternatives
Brief Intro into a Personal Risk Management

Looking for Google alternative services, you should consider not only obvious privacy and security options, just like a good manager looking for a replacement of critical employee is not considering only professional skills of the candidate. 
Exposing your personal data, your personal life to the internet, a hostile informational Wild West, better to be prepared, than not to be. Words like “Risk Management” trigger visions hedge funds mangers, solving Equations of Ultimate Hell Enrichment, but for simple people or even for simple businesses it could be wrapped up into three simple steps
1.	Risk Identification
2.	Rist Assessment
3.	Risk Mitigation
Before you started Googling (eh! Believe it or not, we are here not to use Google ever again!), I will explain, there’s no Rocket Science whatsoever.
Risk Identification – is a simple description of something unpleasant which may happen to you or your data (and consequently, to you). In the worst-case scenario, your private data is on public domain, and you see personalized ads: “Your Grandma deserves new teeth implants”, with a smiling photo of your Grandma. But risks could be far less obvious. You may find your service secure and protected, but can’t use it, because it’s not designed for a normie user. Or you can start using it as a communication platform, but you don’t have anyone to communicate with, because none of your friends use it. You may spend time configuring and learning how to use new features of your private email service, only to find you can’t export your old contacts. You got the point by that moment. Fear not, I’m here to help you on your journey, because I myself passed, it from the start to the point I realized the journey is a destination. Don't worry, I found the answers we need.
Risk Assessment – after identifying the risk, you perform a formal assessment, by doing research on every possible candidate to replace a faulty service. It’s a complex, multi-step process, and any service has its own specific, but all of them have something in common. Let’s try to find out what we can do.
First, find the Terms of Service (ToS) of the service you are considering to use, and look for keywords something like “user data” or “your data”. No need to read the entire document, find the chapter usually called “Privacy Policy”, most probably all you need is there. Then simpler and shorter Policy terms, then better. On one side, we have WhatsApp, which huge Privacy Policy intentionally made vague and complicated, from the other - we have Signal, which just says “Signal cannot access the content of your messages or calls”. 

Second - functionality you need. This step is the most important from the standpoint of your personal comfort as a user, and the quality of your User Experience. Often open-source solutions offer fewer features with lower quality, or even the feature you demand exists, but the User Experience is completely different. It could be a bit complicated to formalize a list of your requirement, because your favorite “features” could be not even option implemented in the application, it could be a way of displaying data, or smooth export process, or an advanced usability feature which is already on the tips of your fingers – you already don’t even think about it, but you can’t work without it – like? for example, Apple gestures for Mac users.
Since creating such a “must-have list” is such a complicated endeavor, you better approach from the opposite direction. You should launch service you wish to test, in some kind of safe and private environment, if possible (it could be a browser you don’t use for your daily work, for web-service, or virtual machine instance – for the application to test), and perform a number of your usual activities, and ideally, as many as possible including unusual and rarely performed. Careful creating a list of such activities should be the time investment you should not consider as waste or boring stuff – after all, you do serious research, and make your life safer and better.
In the following parts of the article, I will give you real-life working examples of such use-cases, with comprehensive step-by-step analysis.

Then, assess the maturity of the solution under consideration, community support, community trends. If the alternative under consideration is proprietary – consider reputation of the company and research about privacy features. The proprietary solution is not necessarily bad, Apple or Microsoft could deliver totally proprietary solutions, but some of them are better than Google or Facebook offer.

You should consider not so obvious at a first glance thing like diversification, because this is exactly the thing you don’t have using your Google account for all of your services. Communicating, socializing, searching, working, and storing your data on a single platform possess unacceptably high risk. Your data is linked, *connected* into a single entity under your account. It could be acceptable if services tightly coupled logically, like Mail and Calendar, but your cloud storage and your mail have nothing in common. Even if you need to attach a file from your cloud storage to your message, you can just download and attach it, if the file is big, like a movie or iso-image, all cloud providers usually offer a “Share” feature.
The best way to oppose data coupling is a process known as "data compartmentalization”. Isolating your services and activities into separate accounts-compartments, every each of those provided by a separate service provider. The next level of services de-coupling is using separate email for registration, at least for critical services, like mail, file storage, and critical 3rd-party services, like internet banking. 

Consider the complexity of the migration. Migrating some services is extremely easy. Just stop using Google for search, and start using DuckDuckGo. However, it’s more an exception than a rule – other services require multi-step migration, taking weeks or even months, with a careful backup of your information and plan to roll back any moment. The most obvious example is mail service migration. You should not only migrate your messages, contacts and calendar, but you also have to change email for all of the services you use – none of them should use gmail.com domain, ideally, you should have your own domain, to be able to change your service one more time if required. Exactly this process could require weeks and months, depends on how many services where you have in your account.

Think about new opportunities. Not necessarily your new service or product would be less functional than the one offered by Google. While Google considers “average” user experience, and doesn’t have to pay much effort to stay on the top, thanks to monopolistic practices, its competitors may implement much more advanced and exciting features than Google ever had to offer. It could be aliases service and custom domain support for Protonmail, advanced trackers blocker and Container Tabs of Firefox, “desktop mode” for Linux-based smartphones. Explore these features, and consider how they can make your user experience better, if you use them on a daily basis. Does it overweight the possible loss of features you have at the moment and can’t replace, does it worth a risk of migration?

Risk Mitigation refers to the process of planning and developing methods and options to reduce threats - or risks. You may want to implement risk mitigation strategies to identify, monitor and evaluate risks and consequences inherent to completing a specific project, such as using a new product or service. Risk mitigation also includes the actions put into place to deal with issues and the effects of those issues regarding a project.
There are five general strategies to deal with identified risks – accept risk, monitor risk, avoid risk, control risk, and transfer risk. For our project of account migration we simplify these strategies to “accept the risk” and “do something else with risk”. From the first view seems counter-intuitive, if we identified the risk, why should we accept it? Well, the accepted risk may have benefits that overweight the risk, or you simply don’t have a choice but accept it.
As an example, migrating from one closed-source solution to another closed source possess a reasonable amount of risk. However, you may take a decision to migrate from Google Drive to Apple iCloud, because in general Apple’s reputation is better, when it comes to privacy. Also, you may start using MS Office 365 instead of Google Docs, despite MS closed source model, because of the rich features of the solution. Finally, you may get stuck to Google, because of reasons beyond your control, like corporate standards. Accepting none of these risks should be considered “bad”, because you understand and monitor it, and of course, you have the benefits of using the questionable solution, the reason why you accepted the risk.
